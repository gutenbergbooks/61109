<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>"How light it is still!" said Don Vittorio Lante, after
a long silence.</p>

<p>"Evening falls much later among the high mountains,"
suggested Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>The great vault of the sky was ascending, as they were
ascending, from the level of the Val Bregaglia; it passed
over their heads and kept rising, as their eyes contemplated
it quietly, amongst the steep mountain peaks,
now quite green with trees and bushes, now bare and
rugged; rising so immensely towards the horizon, as if
they should not perceive its descending curve. It was
the sky of an uncertain summer day that during the
afternoon had been softly blue, veiled by transparent
clouds, but now had become a very light grey, of great
purity and clearness.</p>

<p>"It is eight o'clock," exclaimed Don Vittorio Lante,
pursuing his quiet thoughts.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock," affirmed Lucio Sabini slowly.</p>

<p>The bells of their horses tinkled faintly in their tranquil
ascent; the torrent on their right, at times violent
and covered with the foam whitening on its rocks, at
times clear and narrow like a brook amidst green
meadows, rumbled noisily and softly as it descended
from the white and cold summits whither they were
ascending, on its way to the warm and monotonous
plains whence they had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall not arrive before half-past eleven," said
Vittorio Lante, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Not before," affirmed Lucio Sabini, in the same
tone. Both were smoking cigarettes: fine smoke
shadows, not clouds, scarcely floated round their faces,
as their carriage continued to ascend, to the calm and
regular paces of the horses, along the accustomed road,
the long road that climbs, amidst a continual renewing
of small and large valleys, of narrow gorges, and vast
stretches, between the two mountain sides on right and
left. At Chiavenna they found that the diligence had
left, owing to a change in the time-table from the
previous year, and for five hours a hired carriage had
been conveying them towards the austere Grissons,
whose outposts were not yet distinguishable.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" said Vittorio Lante, still
continuing his thought aloud. "It is better to arrive
late at St. Moritz than lose a night at Chiavenna."</p>

<p>"Or at Vicosoprano," concluded Lucio Sabini, throwing
away the end of his cigarette.</p>

<p>Both gentlemen settled themselves better in their
places, and drew the large English travelling-rug over
their limbs, with the quiet gestures of those who are
used to long journeys. Just an hour ago they had
halted at Vicosoprano to rest their horses, since they
could not obtain a change: they arrived at six and left
at seven. After giving a glance at the new, white, and
melancholy HÃ´tel Helvetia, where, in a small meadow
in front of the hotel, and around its peristyle, male and
female figures moved about aimlessly, dressed indifferently,
with the insignificant and bored faces of those
who are used to sojourning at solitary pensions on seven
francs a day, and while the annoying bell of the round
table of the "Helvetia" was dinning in their ears, they
descended at the old rustic inn, "The Crown." Round
the arch of the low and broad Swiss doorway ran a motto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in Gothic characters, and the small central balcony had
four or five little bright geranium plants and purple
gentians: a resounding and black wooden staircase led
to the first floor. The innkeeper's blond and florid
daughter, with heightened colour, had served them
rapidly and silently with a simple and characteristic
dinner: to wit, a thick and steaming vegetable soup,
trout in butter, roast fowl, and lastly, English sponge
cake, with acid and fresh gooseberry jam. At the door,
as they were getting into their carriage to set out again,
a very blond Swiss maiden offered them little bunches
of cyclamen, which they still wore, although they were
already slightly faded.</p>

<p>"Are you going to stop long up there, Vittorio?"
asked Lucio Sabini, in a discreet tone.</p>

<p>"Three or four weeks, no longer; and you, Lucio?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; the same I think; I don't know
exactly." And a slight smile, mingled with doubt,
annoyance, and bitterness, appeared and disappeared
about his lips. Even the face of his travelling companion
became thoughtful.</p>

<p>Don Vittorio Lante was fair with thick and shining
chestnut hair, chestnut eyes, now soft and now proud,
but always expressive, and fair, curled moustaches.
His features were fine and he seemed much younger
than his thirty years; the complexion was delicate but
vivacious. On the other hand, Lucio Sabini at thirty-five
was distinctly dark, with black eyes, calm and
thoughtful, pale complexion, very black hair and moustaches,
while he was tall and thin of figure. Vittorio
Lante was of medium height, but well made and agile.
Both were wrapped in thought, and they no longer
smoked. Some time passed; suddenly something far
on high gleamed whitely amidst the increasing shadows.</p>

<p>"It is the glacier," said Lucio Sabini; "the Forno
Glacier." And as if that whiteness, already expanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the night at the edge of the Val Bregaglia, had
sent them an icy blast, they wrapped the rug closer
round them, and hid their gloved hands under its
covering.</p>

<p>"Do you expect to amuse yourself in the Engadine,
Lucio?" asked Vittorio.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am sure to amuse myself very much, as
I do every year."</p>

<p>"Leading a fashionable life?"</p>

<p>"No, making love."</p>

<p>"Have you come to the Engadine to love and to be
loved, Lucio?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," exclaimed the other, with a gentle movement
of impatience and an ironical little smile. "I
never said that: I said that I go to St. Moritz, as I do
every year, to make love."</p>

<p>"That is to say&mdash;to flirt."</p>

<p>"Exactly: you say the English word, I the
Italian."</p>

<p>Suddenly the whiteness that crowned Monte Forno
seemed as if it had been extended to the sky, rendering
it more vast; it was a great white cloud, soft and clear,
since it preceded the moon. All the country changed its
aspect. Before them stood out the great, green wall of
trees, with almost the appearance of a peak, which
separates the Engadine from the Val Bregaglia. Beneath
the appearing and disappearing lunar brightness, behind
the white cloud, a sinuous spiral disclosed itself
amidst the wood like a soft ribbon that came and went,
but ever climbed&mdash;the road which leads to the hill of
the Maloja. Meanwhile, the carriage, reducing its pace,
entered the first bend of the winding way; the clouds
continued to increase, and there was a continuous
alternating of light and shade, according as they conquered
the moon or were conquered by her.</p>

<p>"You like flirting, Lucio?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very much," replied the other, with an intense
smile; "and this is an ideal country for love-making,
Vittorio."</p>

<p>"I know it is. And do you sometimes grow fond of
each other?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I grow fond of them."</p>

<p>"And, perhaps, sometimes you fall in love?"</p>

<p>"One is always a little in love with the person to
whom one makes love," said Lucio Sabini, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"But do you fall in love?" insisted Vittorio.</p>

<p>"Yes, I fall in love, too," Lucio confessed.</p>

<p>"And then? What do you do to cure yourself?"
asked Vittorio Lante, with affectionate curiosity;
"because you do cure yourself, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I keep on curing myself," replied the other sadly,
regarding the clouds that were heaping above, as they
became less white, obscuring and hiding all the light of
the moon. "I cure myself of myself. And if I do not
there is somebody who sees to curing me."</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed as if a boundless sadness was
emanating from what Lucio Sabini was saying and
thinking, from what he was not saying and thinking.
His head was slightly bowed, and his lowered lashes hid
his glance.</p>

<p>"Then you are allowed to come to St. Moritz?"
Vittorio asked in a low voice, as if he were afraid of
being indiscreet.</p>

<p>"I am allowed to come," Lucio replied rather bitterly.
"We can't travel together in summer; some family
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convenances</i> must be obeyed, certain canons have to be
observed&mdash;there are so many things, Vittorio! Well,
I have two months of liberty, two beautiful months you
understand, two long months; sixty times twenty-four
hours in which I am free, in which I delude myself and
believe I am free&mdash;I am free!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>At first his words came sadly, then with increasing
violence, while the last words sounded like a cry of
revolt from a heart oppressed by its slavery.</p>

<p>"Still, she loves you," said Vittorio sweetly, in a
subdued tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, she loves me," admitted Lucio quietly.</p>

<p>"For some time, I think."</p>

<p>"For an eternity, for ten years."</p>

<p>Lucio Sabini in the gloaming looked fixedly at his
companion; then without bitterness, without joy, he
added in an expressionless voice:</p>

<p>"I love her."</p>

<p>Very slowly, to the soft and gentle tinkling of the
horses' bells, the carriage traversed the tortuous road,
through the wood and past some majestic walls, and,
like a vision, the small castle of Renesse appeared on
high, now to the right and now to the left. The air continued
to grow colder. The coachman on the box
seemed to be asleep or dreaming, as he drove his horses,
with bent shoulders and bowed head; even the two
horses seemed to be asleep or dreaming of the ascent to
the Maloja, as they tinkled their bells. And in a dream
firmament the clouds galloped bizarrely, as they were
scattered by the wind, which up above must be blowing
strongly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing more delightful or pleasing than to
make love to these foreigners," resumed Lucio, in a light
tone, but with a slight shade of emotion; "there are
some adorable little women, and girls especially. Some
of them are very fashionable and complex, others are
simple and frank; but some are very inquisitive and
quite distrustful of all Italians."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Vittorio Lante, not without
anxiety.</p>

<p>"We Italians have a very bad reputation," Lucio
replied calmly, as he lit a cigarette. "They obstinately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
believe us to be liars and inconstant in love affairs.
<em>Actors</em> is the defensive word of these foreign women.
But all the same they allow themselves to be attracted
equally by our charm&mdash;because the men of their races
do not trouble themselves to be charming&mdash;and by our
ardour, assumed or real&mdash;because they never see their
men ardent&mdash;and also by a certain invincible poetry that
surrounds our country and ourselves."</p>

<p>"So an Italian can please and conquer mightily up
there?"</p>

<p>"Very much so," replied Lucio serenely.</p>

<p>"And conquer seriously?" again added Vittorio.</p>

<p>"Seriously, no," answered Lucio. "We must not
deceive ourselves; our attractions are for the most
part of brief duration. When August is over at St.
Moritz, to pass the first long week of September together
at Lucerne, afterwards a few days in Paris&mdash;that
suffices!"</p>

<p>"They forget?"</p>

<p>"They forget; our fascination comes from our
presence. At a distance the lover dwindles: their
English and Austrians, their Americans and Russians
take them back&mdash;and all is over. A post card or two
with a poetical motto; then nothing more."</p>

<p>"But if they don't forget?"</p>

<p>"That is seldom," murmured Lucio thoughtfully;
"but it does happen. A Viennese, fair, slim, and most
sympathetic ... two years ago ... she still remembers
me."</p>

<p>"She hoped? She hopes?"</p>

<p>"She hoped; she hopes," replied Lucio thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"She didn't know...?"</p>

<p>"She knew nothing: the dear creatures never know
anything: I try to make them know nothing."</p>

<p>"They think you free?"</p>

<p>"Most free."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You deceive them?"</p>

<p>"I do not deceive them; I am silent"&mdash;and he
smiled slowly.</p>

<p>"And what if one of them, more passionate, were
to fall in love with you, and you seriously with her,
Lucio?"</p>

<p>"That would be very serious indeed," murmured
Lucio sadly.</p>

<p>"In fact, you are bound for ever, Lucio?" asked
Vittorio, with melancholy.</p>

<p>"Yes; for ever," he affirmed, with that inexpressive
voice of his, as if declaring an irrefutable fact.</p>

<p>A great gust of icy wind caught them, causing them
to shudder and tremble with the cold. The great wall
was passed, still a few minutes more and they would find
themselves at the hill of the Maloja. The sky was quite
white with little white clouds on one side, because the
moon was passing behind them, while about the Margna&mdash;the
great mountain with twin peaks nearly always
covered with snow&mdash;the clouds had become black and
threatening with rain and storm.</p>

<p>"Vittorio, Vittorio," exclaimed Lucio Sabini, in an
altered voice; "adultery is a land of madness, of
slavery and death. Don't give your youth and life to it
as I have given mine, even to my last day. Beatrice and
I have been intoxicated with happiness, but we are two
unfortunates. I was twenty-five then, Vittorio, and
she was three years older; but we never thought that
we should throw away our every good, that is the one,
the great, the only good&mdash;liberty! We are lost, Beatrice
and I, in every way, both in our social life and in our
consciences, not through remorse for our sin&mdash;no, for
that was dear to us&mdash;but because of the ashes and
poison it contains."</p>

<p>"Haven't you tried to free yourselves?" asked Vittorio
timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tried, but I was unsuccessful. Beatrice is older
than I am," said Lucio gloomily, "and the idea of being
left horrifies her."</p>

<p>"But she loves you, doesn't she? How can she see
you unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Because she loved me, even she tried, the poor dear,
to free me," Lucio Sabini resumed, with a voice almost
oppressed with tears; "last year she wanted me to
marry Bertha Meyer, the beautiful Viennese&mdash;an exquisite
creature&mdash;but then she never succeeded. Poor,
dear Beatrice! She suffered a thousand deaths. We
suffered together. I love her tenderly, you understand;
and, above all, I cannot see her suffer."</p>

<p>A sad and heavy silence fell upon the twain. Their
teeth almost chattered from the severe cold which had
surprised them, at that advanced hour of the evening
on the high plain of the Maloja.</p>

<p>"Still," continued Lucio Sabini, "every now and then
I feel my body, senses, and spirit weakened in this
terrible slavery. Then, during these horrible crises, here
and there I meet with other women, another woman&mdash;Bertha
Meyer, who was so exquisite, or someone else&mdash;young,
beautiful, free, with heart intact and fresh soul.
In her come from afar, from countries which I know not,
from a race that is foreign to me, I feel mysteriously the
secret of my peace and repose, of the life that remains
for me to live. Ah! what deep, what pungent nostalgia
wounds me, Vittorio, through this fresh soul which has
come to me from afar with all the gifts of existence in her
white hands. I must let the white hands open, which I
sadly repel, and allow the precious treasures they contain
to fall&mdash;and all is lost."</p>

<p>"You make the renunciation?" asked Vittorio sadly.</p>

<p>"I make the renunciation," replied Lucio simply.</p>

<p>The immense and gloomy amphitheatre of the Maloja
disclosed itself, stretched and prolonged itself in almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
incalculable distances before their eyes, through the
singular light that came from the immense sky, traversed
by thick clouds, now white, now grey, now black,
through the whiteness that came from the snows
gathered amidst the twin peaks of the colossal Margna,
and through the snows of Monte Lunghino. The mountains
hemmed in the amphitheatre in an embrace
bristling with peaks, bare, sharp, and black, without
the shade of trees or vegetation; and on the rocks were
tracks, yellowish and whitish tracks, not of paths but
of rocky veins. All was rock from foot to summit;
rocks with angry, desperate, tragic profiles. Here and
there on the level, browner shadows in the obscurity of
the night, appeared three or four uninhabited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chÃ¢lets</i>,
without sound and without light; but below, where the
amphitheatre seemed to continue interminably, flickering
lights in a row indicated a house, or rather a large
edifice, where living beings were.</p>

<p>The deep and most extraordinary silence of the high
land was uninterrupted by human sound or voice, only
the violent gusts of wind produced a giant sigh and a
dull rumbling. Suddenly the moon freed herself from
the clouds and a spreading brightness was diffused on all
the scene, rendering it less tragic, but not less sad. Even
the wind and bare mountains, wrapped in cold and
silvery light, preserved their disdainful and hopeless
aspect, the aspect of rocks that have seen the ages without
ever a blade of grass or a flower. Yet whiter seemed
the snows of the Margna and the Lunghino; and below,
behind the glimmering light of the moon, scintillated
like a great metal shield the lake of Sils. Now and then
the night wind screeched in fury.</p>

<p>"Shall we close the carriage?" Vittorio Lante asked.
"Are you cold?"</p>

<p>"I am cold; but unless you insist on it, I prefer not
to close it. In a closed carriage time becomes eternal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eternal; that's true! This is a long night."</p>

<p>"And the country is so desolate!" said Lucio Sabini.
"But it doesn't matter; you will have delightful evenings
where you are going."</p>

<p>"And you will as well," murmured Vittorio Lante,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Are you going to flirt too?"</p>

<p>"If there is nothing better to do," replied the other
ambiguously.</p>

<p>"Better to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Now they had passed the Maloja Kursaal, that hotel
of four hundred rooms, so isolated amidst the black and
bare mountains, on a desert spot before a deserted and
motionless lake. Some of the windows of the caravanserai
were illuminated, but no sound reached from them.
They skirted the lake, where all the high shadows and
the brightness of the sky were curiously reflected, as
their tints changed from moment to moment.</p>

<p>"Do you want to get married, then?" asked Lucio
Sabini, scrutinising his friend's face, but with a kindly
glance.</p>

<p>"I don't want to; I must," replied Vittorio Lante,
halting nervously at the second verb.</p>

<p>"You must?"</p>

<p>"Ay," affirmed the other, shaking his shoulders and
head, with the double gesture of one who is resigned to
his destiny.</p>

<p>"And why rid yourself of that most precious benefit&mdash;liberty?"
murmured Lucio Sabini, seriously but benevolently.</p>

<p>"Because, dear Lucio," he replied, with a motion of
familiarity and confidence, "I can do nothing with my
liberty. What use would it be to me?"</p>

<p>The other listened very intently, chewing his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Ah, what a weight&mdash;a great past, a great name!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
exclaimed Vittorio, as if he were speaking to himself,
looking at the quiet, brown waters of the lake of Sils.
"I am a Lante, but of the branch of La Scala; for three
generations now the Lante della Scala have been ever
declining as to fortune, power, and relationship, while the
cousins, the Lante della Rovere, have not only kept, but
have increased their fortunes, always allying themselves
for the better with the most powerful, noblest, and richest
families of Europe. My father was already poor when he
had me, and I am thirty and very poor. I am not ashamed
to tell you about it, who have known me for such a time
and wish me well, and certainly sympathise with me."</p>

<p>A frank and almost ingenuous sorrow emanated from
every word of the young man, and nothing base escaped
from such a distressing acknowledgment as his own
poverty.</p>

<p>"You would like to make a grand marriage?" asked
Lucio Sabini, quite without irony.</p>

<p>"My mother, who loves and adores me and suffers
from our decadence, wishes it. She desires, dreams of,
and invokes millions and millions for her Vittorio, for the
house of Lante della Scala, to restore the great palace at
Terni, so as not to sell the park where they want to
found a factory."</p>

<p>"St. Moritz is not lacking in youths who are on the
look-out for a large dowry," said Lucio, thoughtfully
and doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I know that," exclaimed Vittorio mournfully. "I
know quite well that St. Moritz is a meeting-place of
big and little dowry-hunters, from him who seeks two
hundred thousand francs to him who seeks ten million.
And I know that people recognise them and that very
often they are adventurers. Nothing makes me shudder
more, Lucio, than to be mistaken for them. I am not
an adventurer. I am an unfortunate gentleman, whose
lot it is to bear a great name without the means to sustain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it and who has not been taught how to work. I am
a loving son, upon whom an adorable mother has imposed
the duty of setting forth to try a conjugal adventure
up there or somewhere, in homage to the lustre and
claims of the Lante della Scala."</p>

<p>"If you dislike it so much, why attempt it? Why
don't you convince your mother how much there is that
is deplorable, and perhaps humiliating, in these adventures?"</p>

<p>"Because I would have to convince myself first,"
confessed Vittorio Lante sadly. "I, too, suffer from
poverty; I, too, endure our slow agony; I, too, envy
and almost hate my proud cousins&mdash;<em>the others</em>; I, too,
keenly desire luxury and power. How is it to be helped?
We have inherited souls, we have inherited nerves and
feelings! Every now and then, through a feeling of
personal dignity, I rebel against this dowry-hunting
which I have been doing for two or three years; but
directly afterwards obscurity and want inspire me with
genuine horror. What a greedy man I must seem to
you, Lucio! Still, I am a chivalrous man: I am a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"I know others like you honourable and gentle and
good, like you constrained by their destiny," observed
Lucio Sabini, with tender sympathy.</p>

<p>Silently grateful, Vittorio Lante pressed his hand. As
they proceeded the scene changed, and the views became
more attractive. The big clouds had grown denser above
their shoulders, towards the hill of the Maloja, which they
had left some time, and the Val Bregaglia.</p>

<p>Denser they grew and gloomier, laden with the whirlwind
of approaching night. The moon on high hung
over the gentle bends of the lake of Sils.</p>

<p>Along the lake, full of deep nocturnal greens, which a
band of light cut in the middle, ran banks quite green
with large and small pines, and even on the travellers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
left, along the high mountain wall they were skirting,
little meadows appeared and disappeared. Amidst the
rocks, trees and shrubs reared themselves, and often the
carriage-wheels beat down flowers from fragrant hedges.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I had another name and another soul," said
Vittorio Lante, after a brief silence.</p>

<p>"What would you do?"</p>

<p>"I would be content with what I have. My mother
and I between us have fifteen hundred lire a month:
this will be left us after we have sold everything and
paid our creditors. Fifteen hundred lire! With another
name and another soul one could, to all appearance, live
comfortably on this sum; and I could marry Livia Lante
della Scala."</p>

<p>"A relation?"</p>

<p>"A cousin&mdash;so graceful, so sweet, and such a
dear."</p>

<p>"Poor?"</p>

<p>"Even poorer than I am: not a penny&mdash;a great name,
a great past, and not a pennyworth of dowry!"</p>

<p>"Does she love you?"</p>

<p>"She loves me quietly, in silence, without any hope.
Ah, what a dear creature!"</p>

<p>He sighed deeply as he gazed below at the white,
modest houses of Sils Maria amidst tall trees.</p>

<p>"Do you love her, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"I am very fond of Livia, nothing more."</p>

<p>"Would you be happy with her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I were another man."</p>

<p>For a long stretch of road they said nothing more. By
one of those very rapid changes, that in the high mountains
astonish by their violence or their intense sweetness,
the night sky had become as clear as crystal: the air had
become so limpid that great distances could be clearly distinguished
by the moon's rays. A rustling, cold, refreshing
breeze came from afar, ruffling the waters of the lake;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but behind them, very far-away, there was a mass of
black clouds which they did not turn round to look at.
On that summer night the noble, solitary mountains
pencilled themselves in great precise lines, whose virgin
snows threw a whiteness upon the lakes and the large
woods and spinneys which skirted their waters, forming
beneath the light of the moon many peninsulas and little
promontories, and upon the immense meadows, where
amidst the soft green grass coursed brooks and little
torrents with gentle singing; also upon the villages
seized by slumber, with little barred windows upon
whose sills tiny rose plants, geraniums, and gentians
slept in floral slumber.</p>

<p>On high, amidst the dark green of the last spinney, the
bright turrets of the Villa Storey pointed to the accomplishment
of their journey. The two gentlemen, who
had almost reached the end of their long drive, tired and
bruised of limb, exalted by their deep, mutual striving,
and by having confessed, almost unconsciously, how
great was the pitiable and fatal essence of their lot, and
exalted by a singular increase of their life, by the
solemnity of the solitary night, the immense, austere,
yet persuasive silence that surrounded them, by that
pacifying light, and by the presence of a beauty&mdash;the
simplicity and purity of which they perceived, almost
without thinking about it&mdash;desired, yes, desired a new
heart, a new soul, and another destiny. They desired
that nothing of what had happened to them should
happen again, that all the past should vanish, that
everything should change&mdash;persons, sentiments, deeds.
For an instant strongly did they desire this&mdash;for an
instant!</p>

<p>The rocky banks of the Inn were in front of them, and
their carriage bumped up and down on the small wooden
bridge that spans the noisy little river at the entrance of
St. Moritz Bad. Around them were little white houses;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on the banks amidst the trees the church spires dominating
the heights, and the imposing hotels upon which
fluttered to the cold mountain breeze the red flag with
white cross. Up above on a small hill was the village of
St. Moritz Dorf, all white beneath the moon.</p>

<p>Every pure, fine, pious desire vanished in a trice. They
remembered them no more and became the men of old, of
always. Their nerves and senses were anxiously stretched
out to pleasure, to luxury, to caprice; and they were
bitten by a pungent curiosity for new joys, new loves,
new fantasies&mdash;to last an hour, a day, a month, then
afterwards suddenly to be forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Smiling softly and showing her little flashing teeth,
in a mouth as red as a carnation and whimsically
opened, Mabel Clarke was counting with the point of her
umbrella the boxes on the truck&mdash;large boxes of yellow or
maroon leather, either long and soft or high and massive,
with shining brass clasps and locks, and long stripes
painted a vivid white and red, upon which was described
a large red "C." Standing beneath the roof of the pretty
little station of Coire, amongst the crowd that surged, as
it waited from minute to minute the departure of the
Engadine Express, Mabel Clarke, tall, slender, upright,
in her pearl-grey, tailor-made dress, which outlined all
her youthful grace, not wanting in a certain expression of
robustness and strength, watched the porters who were
placing their boxes in the train. She counted up to
eighteen, of all forms and dimensions, with the great
clamorous "C" in blood red.</p>

<p>"Eighteen," she exclaimed, turning round. "Eighteen,
isn't that so, dear Broughton?"</p>

<p>An elderly woman, with hair more white than grey,
quietly dressed in black, nodded her head, with a gesture
not lacking in respect.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that is all?" resumed Mabel Clarke,
with a slight frown of her dark chestnut eyebrows on the
white forehead. "Eighteen seems very few for mamma
and me."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clarke expects four boxes from Paris. Everything
was not ready from the tailor's to leave with us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, very well, then!" murmured Mabel Clarke,
nodding her head. Turning her back, she approached
her mother, who, patiently seated beneath the station
roof near a little buffet table, had been served with a
cup of coffee, which she was not drinking.</p>

<p>Mabel had continually to pass different groups of
people who were massing together for departure. Pushed
about and jostled, she reached her mother at last, and
asked, with a little smile:</p>

<p>"All right, mamma?"</p>

<p>"All right, rather bored," replied Mrs. Clarke, shaking
her head, as she regarded the crowd with a lofty and
silent expression of fastidiousness.</p>

<p>Men, women, and children were coming and going;
strolling, stopping, and running. There were old ladies
dressed in black, with awkward round hats from which
hung a dark blue or brown veil, and who were pressing
round their necks large fur tippets against the cold which
had surprised them on leaving the train. There were
young women dressed brightly, with large, light travelling-cloaks
left open, beneath which appeared short skirts and
elegantly booted feet, and hats enveloped in white veils.
There were children of various ages, watched over carefully
by nurses and governesses, and there was even a
nurse with a dress of white and grey stripes, a large white
and grey cloak, and an encircling cap of white ribbons
above her mass of hair: she carried the baby in her
arms, wrapped in a little white fur jacket, all rosy in its
infantile sleep.</p>

<p>Men of every race and age mingled with the women
they were accompanying: they separated from them,
returned and disputed. There were fine old men&mdash;tall
and thin, of energetic and handsome countenance&mdash;beardless
old men, with invincible, lordly stamp in face
and person, and other old men, stout, with heightened
complexion and heavy moustaches, with a gay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thoughtless air; then middle-aged men, some of a consumptive
appearance, but bearing traces of former virile
beauty, others showing signs of pleasures enjoyed too
violently. There were robust young men, well made,
whose faces, though regular and perfect in feature,
lacked expression; while other youths, whose appearance
was fashionable, but slender and delicate, had
colourless complexions, and in all their aspect an absence
of health. On all this curious and attractive variety&mdash;a
great mass of men of every age&mdash;there was a decided
ugliness, a common awkwardness, though varied in form,
and a proud, harsh expression. According to their ages
and conditions this rudeness, imperiousness, and clownishness
assumed different aspects, but it was manifest in the
high and insolent voices that spoke German, in the gestures,
now grotesque and now solemn, but ever imperious&mdash;the
German crowd dominating nearly all the other
nations.</p>

<p>Beyond the peculiar character of their clothes there
were to be recognised those whom the trains from Calais,
Brussels, Vienna, and Berlin had brought together at
Paris or Basle to make up the great cosmopolitan Engadine
train: the Englishman with white shoes, check
overcoat, turned-up trousers, cloth cap; the Frenchman
with light cloak, which he was wrapping round himself,
as he already felt chilly and caught by the keen mountain
air. Finally, and above all, there was the great mass of
Germans, clothed in suits which were too baggy, or too
long, or too short, of strange cut and gloomy colours, and
in stranger cloaks. But especially there was the Tyrolese
costume, with its short breeches, jacket of big pleats, and
belt of the same cloth; on the head a green cap always
too small, with a narrow crease, a myrtle-green cap, like
the suit, with a Tyrolese feather behind that resembled
an interrogation mark. These suits were worn on fat
bodies and thin, or broad and bony, and the cap on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
square head, with ruddy cheeks, blond moustaches, and
peeling neck in reddish-purple folds. Lower down,
standing apart, one of them, one only, had an imposing
stature and a robust head, a face with a black beard,
rough and bristly, with two eyes of sweetest blue; he
the only one among so many, apart, solitary, and silent.</p>

<p>While the long and complicated work of loading the
baggage of the crowd was being accomplished, Mabel
Clarke, keeping close to her mother, watched with her
large grey eyes, full of an ardent curiosity of life, those
who were moving around her. Not far from her two
ladies were seated round another <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cafÃ©</i> table. One of them
was of uncertain age, dressed in black, with a black hat
and a decided grey veil; the other was a very young
figure, bending as she wrote the addresses on several post
cards. Nothing was revealed save the lines of a white and
delicate face and the curve of a pretty mouth, closed and
smileless. Beneath the light blue veil her hair was very
blond and pleasant to the eye, while the hand that ran
over the cards as she wrote was very white.</p>

<p>"English," said Mabel, almost to herself, with a rather
pretty little laugh of disparagement.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her mother, with a rather more pronounced
laugh. The writer raised her head, and revealed
a quite pale face beneath whose very transparent complexion
coursed a pink flush. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> was white
and virginal, an appearance which was still more increased
by the white travelling-dress. The smile round
Mabel Clarke's beautiful but jesting mouth increased.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poitrinaire, peut-Ãªtre</i>," murmured her mother in
French, with a strong American accent.</p>

<p>The daughter's eyes were averted, attracted by another
feminine figure: a young woman who beside her was
sprinkling drops of water on a bunch of roses that she
was pressing to herself, which appeared faded owing to
the length of the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>She was slender and tall, with a little erect and proud
head, and a refined face with charming features, without
true beauty, but charming in their harmony, with a
staidness of postures and gestures and a ladylike and
disdainful aloofness from whatever was happening around
her. Two or three times Mabel regarded her and made
some lively movement to attract her attention. The
other did not turn round and observed nothing in her
gracious and proud aloofness.</p>

<p>"French: exquisite," sighed Mabel Clarke.</p>

<p>"Exquisite," sighed her mother, even more deeply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guttural German cries announced the
departure for the Engadine, and the crowd thronged at
the doors, carrying characteristic hand luggage; tennis-rackets
in their coverings, travelling-cloaks, sticks with
chamois-horn handles and iron-spiked tips, and leather
cases with golf-clubs.</p>

<p>As they clambered up, from short skirts the ladies
disclosed dainty feet, shod some of them as if they were
to walk through the boulevards of Paris, and others as
if they must immediately climb the Bernina. Mabel
Clarke and her mother, followed step by step, like
a shadow, by Mrs. Broughton, approached without
undue hurry the large compartment which they had
reserved. A railway official advanced, as if searching
amidst the crowd, with a yellow envelope in his
hands.</p>

<p>At once Mrs. Clarke summoned him.</p>

<p>"A telegram for Clarke?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</i>," said the man, offering the envelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarke read her telegram quietly.</p>

<p>Mabel in a whisper asked:</p>

<p>"Papa! all right?"</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Loudly the German voices of the railway officials
resounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thusis, Preda, Bergun, Tiefenkastel, St. Moritz&mdash;St.
Moritz&mdash;St. Moritz."</p>

<p>As the train left overflowing with travellers, from the
lowered windows there was an appearing and disappearing
of heads, veiled in white and grey, in blue and brown;
there was a fluctuating of faces, fresh or consumptive,
while some large German face all aflame, with great
yellow moustaches and green Tyrolese cap that pressed
the square forehead, would lean out to exchange loud
and harsh German words with a friend, who might have
been his brother, so much did he resemble him, as he
raised his head from the station platform.</p>

<p>"St. Moritz! St. Moritz! St. Moritz!"</p>

<p>This was the last feeble echo which reached the
travellers who were already on their way. For some
minutes there was a sound of windows being raised
rapidly against the fresh, almost cold, evening air; and
no face leant out throughout the long train to gaze
at the country where the Tamina places its whirlpool
gorges beneath high rocks, while the flowering gardens
of La Rezia smile around pretty white villas, which are
more Italian than Swiss. For some time no one passed
in the narrow corridor that flanked the first-class compartments;
everyone remained quietly in his place.</p>

<p>In their reserved compartment&mdash;six places for three
people&mdash;Mrs. Clarke and Miss Mabel Clarke of the great
house of Clarke of New York, of which John Clarke,
husband and father, was the soul, with his great talent
and magnificent business activity&mdash;the house of Clarke
rated at six hundred actual millions, John Clarke himself
at three hundred millions, and Miss Mabel credited
with a dowry of fifty millions&mdash;mother and daughter,
silent and quiet, were receiving the most minute attentions
from Mrs. Broughton, so that the remainder of the
journey of three hours and a half might be comfortable
for the two ladies. Mrs. Clarke especially accepted these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
attentions with the aspect of a cold and silent idol. Mrs.
Broughton opened some large travelling rugs of fur and
the little white and grey feathers of the eider, and
wrapped them round the two ladies. She drew forth
five or six cushions of stamped leather and Liberty silk,
and placed them behind Mrs. Clarke's shoulders and at
her side; she made long play with a silver and cut-glass
scent bottle, sending into the air, on the windows and
seats of the compartment, a little shower of eau de
Cologne, together with another, rather stronger, perfume,
perhaps a disinfectant; and she hung on the linings of
the compartment two or three portable electric lamps to
illuminate them when night came, and to enable them
to read better. In an open, red leather case, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nÃ©cessaire</i>,
full of everything for making tea in the train, shone with
its warm tones of silver-gilt. Afterwards she gave a
questioning and respectful glance to her chief mistress,
Mrs. Clarke, who either did not notice her, or did not
deign to do so, and another glance at Mabel Clarke, who
replied with the shortest little nod in the negative. Mrs.
Broughton settled herself in a far corner of the compartment,
drew forth from a bag a long note-book, and with
a small pencil began to write some notes and figures
therein. Suddenly Mrs. Clarke awoke from her proud
torpor, and said:</p>

<p>"Broughton, the big and small boxes?"</p>

<p>The woman understood at once, and rising, pointed to
two long boxes, or rather coffers, on the rack, of yellow
leather with steel locks and clasps, and added:</p>

<p>"I checked them before starting."</p>

<p>Suddenly Mabel asked:</p>

<p>"Mamma, did you bring your large pearl necklace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"And the large diadem?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And, mamma, did you bring the tiara?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"The tiara, of course! It was necessary."</p>

<p>Mabel approved, with a charming smile. Then she
resumed:</p>

<p>"Mamma, they say the Italians at St. Moritz have
extraordinary jewels."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"They say so. Also some South American ladies have
great pearls and diamonds, mamma."</p>

<p>"Do you believe all of them can be more beautiful
than my jewels? Mabel, do you think so?"</p>

<p>And a keen expression of uneasiness, the first that had
animated that marble countenance, seized her.</p>

<p>"To me it seems impossible," added Mabel thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Also to me it seems impossible."</p>

<p>In the next compartment were two ladies alone, who
had also taken six places for themselves. One was a
woman of thirty, with a very white face slightly coloured
as to the cheeks, with two marvellous large eyes of deep
grey, somewhat velvety, while the whites of the pupils had
a blue reflection. Her mouth was vivid and sinuous, more
expressive than beautiful. Her hair was of a very bright
and fine chestnut, massed round the neck and waving
over the temples. Only the temples showed a streak of
blue veins, and the little ears were exceedingly white.
One of the hands, bared of its kid glove, showed long,
graceful, but bony fingers. She who accompanied her
was the image of her, though with thirty more years;
but she was very fat, with an expression of perfect good-nature
on the broad face and an unexplainable sense of
fear in the eyes that had remained childish.</p>

<p>The younger woman was dressed in white cloth; but
she wore a long jacket of otter with chinchilla facings of
a soft grey, which suited her rather morbid beauty, and
she remained huddled in her furs, as if cold, with her head
snuggled in the collar. Sometimes she coughed a little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Then her mother started, became disturbed, and questioned
her a little anxiously in German. The daughter
scarcely replied, in a whisper, and settled herself better
in her corner, as she dreamed with closed eyes. A scent
of sandal emanated from her, and all the minute, very
elegant luggage bore her initials, an "E." and an "L."&mdash;Else
Landau&mdash;with a baronial coronet.</p>

<p>All was silent, too, in a compartment further on, full of
ladies. The exquisite French lady, of the faded roses,
preserved her aspect of one who neither sees nor hears,
since she neither wishes to see nor hear. Her hands,
gloved in new white gloves, held an open book, whose
title was not to be discovered, since it was hidden in an
antique silk book cover. She turned over the pages very
seldom, perhaps keeping the book open so as not to
occupy herself with her neighbours. There was a dark
lady, with fine arched eyebrows, black, passionate eyes,
a carnal and florid mouth, and all this beauty augmented
and made artificial by the rouge on the cheeks, the black
beneath the eyes, and the carmine on the lips. She was
still a very young woman, but she was got up like an old
one. Every now and then the dark woman, so strangely
embellished, exchanged a word with her husband, who
came to see her from another compartment, where he
had found a seat. The husband was tall and gross, with
a rather truculent countenance and big rings on his
fingers. They spoke Spanish. The third lady, the English
girl, she who was writing post cards in the station at
Coire, kept silence behind the window that gave on to
the corridor. Now all the virginal purity of her very
white face was apparent beneath the slightly blue
shadow of her veil. Beneath the mother-of-pearl complexion
a rosiness spread itself almost at every beating
of the arteries. The closed lips, together with the eyes of
periwinkle-blue, which gazed in sweetness and candour,
all spoke of the fragile and fascinating beauty of Anglo-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Saxon
women, whose grace is invincible. Her companion
was beside her; but she must have been used to the
patient silences of long journeys.</p>

<p>As the train climbed in bizarre curves and loops the
great pass of Albula, crossing daring bridges and more
daring viaducts, ever climbing from Thusis, from Solis,
from Tiefenkastel, not one of those travellers gave a
thought to the singular and powerful ascent of the train,
as it elevated itself ever more and more towards its lofty
point of arrival. Here there was a lively chattering in
German, in French, in English, especially in German;
there someone was slumbering in his seat; here two men
and two women were playing bridge. Others were trying
to read big papers like the "Koelnische Zeitung," "The
Times," and the "Temps." Some governesses and nurses
were watching two or three compartments full of children.
A French preceptor, a priest, was talking in a low voice to
a youth who was accompanying him; the nurse was walking
with her baby in the corridor with slow and heavy
step. Now and then some young man came and went
hurriedly in the corridor, giving a glance at all the compartments
where the ladies were, stopping behind the
windows where some feminine profile was to be seen,
with particular curiosity at the last compartment, where
Mrs. Clarke, very bored with the slow journey, as she
said, had lowered the blinds.</p>

<p>No one knew anything, or wished to, of that summer
night and its cold gusts passing over the heights of the
Lenzerhorn and mounting to Preda, to Filisur, to Bergun,
penetrating the heart of the mountains, and issuing from
them to cross the deep valleys, leaving to right and left
peaks covered with snow, to which no one gave a glance
through the windows as they rumbled across fantastic
bridges that joined two precipices. No one knew or
wished to know how rich with Alpine perfumes was the
summer night, nor how the voices of forest, meadow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
waters around the train were forming the great mountain
chorus without words. No one knew or wished to know
what a tremendous and mortal thing it had been for mind
and hands and life of man to construct that iron road of
the high mountains, and how many existences had been
scattered there. Each trembled with impatience, anticipating
the halting of the train at little stations all of wood
behind which some houses gleamed white or a church
tower rose.</p>

<p>The women were slumbering or thinking or dreaming
behind their veils. Each repressed her impatience to
arrive up there, whither she was carrying either a great,
keen longing, or one more subdued, or an unrestrainable
curiosity, a need of health, or a humble, secret dream.
Some were talking to cheat the waiting, and exchanging
names of hotels; and old frequenters of the Engadine
were instructing novices with a knowing air. There was
not one of them who was not aspiring with secret ardour&mdash;sprung
from the idlest or perhaps most puerile instincts,
or moral and material necessity, or from a dream&mdash;to the
goal, to St. Moritz; careless of everything except of
arriving up there, where their life should suffer the whip's
lash, or the triumph of vanity, or the victory of ambition,
or health regained, or pleasure broadly conquered, or an
unknown fortune taken by assault. And when in the
evening the word <em>Samaden</em> was clearly and precisely
heard, and each felt that the goal was almost touched,
every torpor was scattered, every silence was interrupted,
every dream released before the reality. Jumping to
their feet in extreme impatience, all of them crowded to
the windows and doors. Still some minutes and yet more,
and then the word resounded from carriage to carriage,
repeated softly and loudly from a hundred voices:</p>

<p>"St. Moritz! St. Moritz! St. Moritz!"</p>

<p>In the obscurity of the night the spectacle unfolded
itself as if in a broad, deep stage setting. All the hill was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gleaming with lights, now feeble, now flaming. In
capricious and charming lines burnt the lights of the
Palace Hotel, in lines direct and uniform those of the
Schweizerhof; like an immense edifice perforated with a
thousand windows, like a colossal plaything of giant
babies, flamed the white Grand Hotel, and further on
high, at the summit, in triple lines, gleamed at the foot
of the mountains, the HÃ´tel Kulm. Around these mastodons
shone the other houses and smaller hotels.</p>

<p>The blaze of lights from the Palace and the Grand
hotels, and from the whole crown of large lamps which
illuminated the road from the village to the baths, was
wonderfully reflected in the dark lake; thus the lights
were multiplied and eyes and soul were dazed thereby.
On the opposite bank the wood, which skirted the lake,
the Acla Silva, had neither house nor light in its sylvan
austerity. Directly above on the Rosatch and Curvatsch
the whiteness of the snow became even purer in the dark
night. Very far-away, in a circle on the horizon, the snows
of the Julier, the Polaschin, and the Albana gleamed
whitely, and still further away at the extremity glistened
the Margna with her twin peaks. A thousand eyes could
not turn away from that beacon of light which streamed
from hotels and houses in patches, while from below,
from the Bad, long green streaks of colour flickered as
they were reflected in the lake. At the vision which
scorched eyes and heart, as the train drew up at the little
terminus, there was a crowding and jostling to descend
and touch that land of every promise, and to be immersed
in that light.</p>

<p>The omnibus conductors of the great hotels were
running hither and thither as they gathered together
their travellers; noisily luggage was piled upon luggage,
and carriages departed and carriages returned in rapid
movement. White, green, and grey omnibuses were
crammed with travellers, and the laden vehicles turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and disappeared to the rapid trot of their good horses,
towards the upper village and the baths on the shores of
the lake. St. Moritz Dorf flamed scintillatingly in the
night, and flamed more blandly and afar St. Moritz Bad.</p>

<p>Around Mrs. Clarke and the smiling Mabel Clarke a
circle of railway officials, servants, and porters was
formed; the secretary of the "Palace" arrived in a
hurry in a private carriage, and was obsequiously talking
in English in a low voice. Mollified, the mother received
the homage, and Mabel smiled at the flaming lights of
the uplands where for a month she was to pass a gay
and vivid existence, where her fresh and strong youth
should be intoxicated with joy. They left in the carriage
with Mrs. Broughton and the secretary.</p>

<p>The exquisite French lady also left alone in a carriage,
still tranquil, still aloof, gave the address of the
"Palace." The Viennese, Else von Landau, with the
large otter furs, who coughed and smelled of sandal-wood,
got into a carriage, and the mother with the
startled eyes climbed in with her and gave an address
towards St. Moritz Bad.</p>

<p>The young Spanish woman, so made up, who was
bound for the Grand Hotel, departed, disputing in rapid
Spanish with her husband and appearing annoyed at
going to an hotel different from the Palace Hotel,
whither she had seen so many people of aristocratic
appearance bound. But no one, whether climbing into
omnibus, or jumping into carriage, or taking on foot
the path that leads to the Dorf, gave a single glance to
the majestic mountains that had seen the passing of the
ages, to the proud and solitary peaks so near to the sky,
to the quiet and dark waters of the lake, to the brown
woods, whence came fresh and sharp fragrances. None
gave them a glance. All were trembling with satisfaction
at having arrived at last; and were eager to immerse
themselves in the exalting stream of life up there amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the light and the luxury and joy of fantasy and senses.
The young English girl only, of the virginal countenance,
before climbing into the "Kulm" bus, raised her veil,
and gazed with her periwinkle-blue eyes at the white
heights so deserted and imposing. A smile for the first
time bloomed on the pure mouth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The large clock with face all of blue and hours marked
in gold, which adorns the slender, upright spire of
the English church, sounded ten; its grave and harmonious
tones spread themselves in long, far-reaching
waves from the Dorf upon the light and fresh morning
air. Standing at the door of the HÃ´tel Caspar Badruth,
Lucio Sabini, who was just dressed, aristocratically
fashionable, with his slender, tall figure, and calm and
peaceful countenance beneath the brim of his soft, dark
grey felt hat, compared the time with his watch. With
even and elastic step, casting a limpid, tranquil glance,
now at the bright celestial blue of the horizon, now at
the deep, dense greenery of the pines, now at the bright
green of the dewy meadows, regarding everything with
eyes that were kindly and at times full of tenderness,
he descended the footpath from the Dorf to St. Moritz
Bad. Ahead of him a woman's figure was also going
with even step, in a costume of correct cut, though
perhaps a little severe, of a rather purple hue, with a
white hat surrounded by a purple veil. In the features
and very fair hair, proud profile, and pale cheeks he
recognised the Comtesse Marcella de la FertÃ© Guyon,
a young French lady whom he knew slightly, from meeting
her for two or three years at St. Moritz, and who
always exercised upon him the attraction of silent and
proud women who surround themselves with mystery,
to conceal a love, a sorrow, a tragedy, or even to hide
their aridness and coldness for all such things which for
a long time have been dead within them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do I disturb you, madam?" he asked, placing
himself beside the Countess, after having greeted her,
with the easy yet serious grace that was particularly his.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she replied, with a very slight smile, both
courteous and proud. "I am going to St. Moritz Bad."</p>

<p>"So am I. You are going for a walk like me?"</p>

<p>"Like you, I think not," she murmured, but kindly.</p>

<p>"And why, Signora?"</p>

<p>The Countess was silent for an instant, as if hesitating
in her reserve.</p>

<p>"I am going to church," she replied hurriedly, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto
voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed the other, reproved, "is it a festival
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not a feast day," she murmured, without
adding anything further.</p>

<p>"Are you going to the Catholic church of the Bad?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is less full of well-known people, of smart
people," she murmured, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>"I imagine, madam, that you will pray for all sinners?"
he asked, forcing a smile, to enliven the gloomy
conversation.</p>

<p>"I try to," she replied vaguely.</p>

<p>"Then through you I am sure to obtain grace from
Heaven," he concluded, with a smile.</p>

<p>The lady glanced at him with her proud, already
distant eyes, from which in the past rivers of tears must
have flowed, clouding them for ever. Lucio bowed,
pressed the hand she offered him, and left her, walking
a little more rapidly to get away and leave her in freedom.</p>

<p>"She is a tower of ivory, but so interesting," he
thought, as he lightly resumed his way in the soft air.</p>

<p>For an instant, moved by a keen desire to conquer
and penetrate that solitary, closed soul, he thought of
getting Francis Mornand, who was the fashionable
chronicler of the Engadine, to tell him the private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
history of the Comtesse Marcella de la FertÃ© Guyon, to
lay siege to that heart, and with a complete knowledge
of its long agony, to obtain a precious victory there,
where no one should again penetrate. That sudden and
strange desire of his of conquest over the prisoner who
believed in her own freedom fascinated him. But a
young woman's face was smiling at him from some
distance as she came towards him, and he halted beside
a young girl who was climbing towards the Dorf with
rapid steps, while her mother, a middle-aged woman,
followed more slowly. She was a girl of rare beauty,
with large, dark eyes furnished with long, dark lashes,
a lovely mouth curved up a little at the corners, like
that of a Greek statue of Erigone, and a white complexion
over which was suffused a flush of health.</p>

<p>Still, every now and then the eyes became hard,
with a scrutinising glance&mdash;the mouth closed with a
half-mocking and half-disdainful smile, and her whole
countenance, that resembled a flower of youth and
beauty, seemed a flower laden with poison. Lucio
Sabini and Lia Norescu, a young Roumanian, immediately
plunged into a lively, gay, and slightly sarcastic
conversation, while the mother listened silently, with
an air of complacency and indulgence.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is our divine Lia!" Lucio exclaimed, as
he held the little gloved hand in his. "St. Moritz was
dead without you."</p>

<p>"The Society For The Embellishment of St. Moritz
made me come," she replied, laughing; "the Kurverein
wrote to me, and I couldn't resist."</p>

<p>"And how many suitors? How many flirts?"</p>

<p>"Many, far too many; I can spare some for other
girls."</p>

<p>"New and old?"</p>

<p>"Many new and few old; nearly all new."</p>

<p>"Handsome, rich, amusing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nearly all tiresome."</p>

<p>And a gesture of contempt contracted her mouth, that
so much resembled a flower, and the eyes became wicked.</p>

<p>"And with whom are you flirting, Sabini?"</p>

<p>"I should like to flirt with you; but you have always
spurned me."</p>

<p>"Always!"</p>

<p>"Even now?"</p>

<p>"Even now. Why don't you flirt with Madame
Lawrence, the beautiful Lawrence, the divine Lawrence,
this year's professional beauty?"</p>

<p>"Thanks! She is too beautiful for me. Like you,
she has twelve flirts."</p>

<p>"I have fourteen," replied Lia Norescu promptly, as
she flashed her magnificent eyes. "And Miss Clarke,
with her dowry of fifty, one hundred, or one hundred
and fifty millions; why not pay court to her?"</p>

<p>Never in a soft womanly voice, in a voice young and
sweet, in a French pronounced exquisitely, hissed such
irony and such bitterness.</p>

<p>"I do not pay court to millionaire girls," replied
Lucio Sabini, a little coldly.</p>

<p>"You court the others, the poor ones," replied Lia
vivaciously; "but you marry neither: you don't want
to marry anyone."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am always well informed," replied Lia profoundly;
"it is impossible to deceive me."</p>

<p>"Then you are a girl without illusions?"</p>

<p>"I am a monster, Sabini; I have no illusions." And
they left each other, both laughing loudly and falsely
at the last word. Ah, he knew the secret of Lia Norescu,
the beautiful Roumanian girl, who spoke and wrote five
languages perfectly, who was of high mettle, and who
for five years had been everywhere cosmopolitan society
was to be found, at Cairo, Nice, Rome, St. Moritz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Ostend, and Biarritz, in search of a rich husband&mdash;very
rich, immensely rich&mdash;for she had not even a penny for
a dowry. Her father and mother, her brothers and
cousins, all urged on the beautiful girl this marriage of
money, and some of them, at an immense sacrifice,
provided the travelling expenses; some gave the dresses,
and some the cloaks and hats. Lia Norescu appeared
everywhere, like a flower laden with an irresistible attraction,
followed by the quiet and indulgent mother who
adored her daughter, and everywhere she had her court
of admirers, an ever-changing court. No one held out
more than one or two seasons, all vanished and others
appeared. But no one remained, and the flower within
her soul contained an ever greater poison of disillusion.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl, poor little girl," murmured Sabini
to himself, with sincere sympathy, as he withdrew. He
was sorry for that splendid creature, forced at twenty-two
to fight a hard fate without results, when her beauty
had the most imperious right to riches and luxury. And
softly his spirit fell in love with the idea of being able
to offer to the young woman of irresistible beauty the
treasures of the earth, of offering her a rich and powerful
friend, or a brother of his, or himself, perhaps, so that
all the deep poison which rendered that flower venomous
might vanish, and Lia Norescu might be a colour, a
perfume, a splendour without cark and fret, without
blemish.</p>

<p>By then his steps had absently led him to the meadows
that surround the Catholic church of St. Moritz Bad,
and the soft grass bathed by dew, and brushed by hidden
rivulets, exhaled a pungent fragrance. Desirous of
sensations even more intense in their simplicity, he
ascended a path that leads to a wood dominating the
lake. Already the path, in that vivid, bright hour, in
which the colour almost of heaven was reflected on
everything, with an air which to breathe was almost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
drink the elixir of life, was being traversed by men and
women, in couples and groups; some walking hurriedly
in their desire to immerse themselves in the shade of
the wood, others more slowly, but nearly all silently.
Lucio Sabini's acute eye, on the alert for every fresh face,
a lady's especially, discovered here and there those who,
as they traversed the little path bathed by the sun,
which further on penetrates beneath the trees, as under
a soft arch of verdure, carried in their hearts and glances
and actions the soft and exhilarating beginning of a
little, or perhaps a big love affair. Even more acutely
he scrutinised the faces and expressions of those who,
tired and oppressed by a love declaration too long prolonged,
at which they had grown accustomed, now
refreshed and rested, were again joining hands up there,
as they recognised the clasp of yore amongst the protecting
trees.</p>

<p>He entered the wood alone. A secret, biting nostalgia
seized him because of his solitude on that heavenly
morning. More restlessly and inquisitively his eyes
sought those he met, the eyes of women and girls who,
dressed in white&mdash;graceful matutinal sprites&mdash;came and
went beneath the verdure of the trees, which here and
there the sun's rays rendered bright and yellow. In a
corner of the wood, beneath a lofty pine he discovered
a well-known figure. The woman was seated on a great
white boulder, and with lowered eyes was tracing with
her parasol amongst the grass and stones some strange
letters of a name or a word. Approaching softly he
recognised a Hungarian lady, who was staying alone
in the same hotel&mdash;a Clara Howath, who always appeared
at meal-times carrying a book which she read
during the repast. She had a rather dissipated face, with
two vague, sad eyes and a little pale mouth like a dead
rose: she was fashionably dressed, as seemed natural
to her. Lucio drew nearer, and when he was close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the Hungarian lady he noticed that she was weeping
silently.</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, Madame?" he asked in a low
voice, discreetly.</p>

<p>Clara Howath showed no surprise at his approach, or
that he should be talking to her and asking her so much.
She raised her tear-stricken face, and replied naturally:</p>

<p>"Yes, Signor."</p>

<p>"Can I help you?" he insisted in an insinuating
voice, slightly moved.</p>

<p>"No, Signor," she replied simply.</p>

<p>As he stood beside her and hid her from those who
were passing in the little path, he looked at her attentively.
Her right hand was loaded with precious stones,
the other wore on the ring finger a gold circlet, a love
token.</p>

<p>"Have you lost someone&mdash;someone who was dear to
you?"</p>

<p>Oh, what desolation there was in the woman's eyes
as she raised them to him, so supplicatingly and so
desperately.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" he asked, disturbed.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I have lost him, but he is not dead."</p>

<p>The pale mouth was twisted in sorrow, as if she
wished to stifle a great cry, or a sob. Slightly pale,
Lucio Sabini said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Signora."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter," she replied,
with sad sweetness, shaking her head.</p>

<p>Lucio Sabini's step became slower as he withdrew into
the wood. Suddenly the shining light of the sun amidst
the high branches seemed colourless to him, and feeble
the twittering of the little birds among the bushes, and
languishing the flight of the white butterflies amidst the
fragrant clumps of wild mint and dark wild vanilla.
His heart contracted with sorrow for the strange lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Clara Howath, whose name alone he knew, whose deep
grief, breathed forth from her soul, made her no longer
recognise either the shame of tears or womanly reserve,
to such an extent as to tell all her misery to a stranger
in a public road, amongst strange people passing and
staring. He would have liked to have been <em>the other</em>;
he who was not dead but whom the deserted woman had
lost for ever. He would have liked to have been <em>the
other</em>, so far-off and forgetful, the traitor who had perjured
himself and forgotten; so that he might return
to the wood, where the azure of the firmament and the
blue of the lake peeped amidst the trees, to take that
unhappy woman in his arms and kiss away her tears.</p>

<p>Drawing farther away he was once more Lucio Sabini,
and the visions seen that morning were already settling
in his imagination; but still more feverishly within him
became the need of the unknown love, of the unknown
lady whom he had come to seek amongst the mountains,
of the woman whom he should love an hour, a day, a
month, and whom he should never see again, who
perhaps might love him for a summer evening or a
summer morning: but an unknown woman of another
land and another race.</p>

<p>Up above, in a remote corner of the wood, he halted
and sat down on a tree trunk, which perhaps had been
struck down by lightning in an autumnal storm, or
perhaps had been transported from the heights of
Corvatsch by the fury of the torrent in winter. The
trunk lay there amongst the tall grass and rocks, the
little violas with yellow eyes, and tall and slender
marguerites. Lucio sat down and drew from his coat
pocket a lady's purse which he had found the day before,
towards dusk, at the Dorf, in a solitary lane close to the
tennis-courts. It was a smallish purse of chain silver,
with a broad encircling silver hinge adorned with three
large turquoises; a silver chain kept it suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
through two rings. For the fourth time Lucio opened
the lady's purse, and again examined its contents,
minutely and curiously. First of all there was a little
handkerchief of white cambric, adorned with a fine
embroidery of white flowers, and in the corner was a
tiny initial&mdash;an "L." From the cambric a subtle and
feverish perfume exhaled: every time as Lucio placed
it to his nostrils he had a sense of delight. He repeated
the gesture, and again he had the same sensation. The
purse also contained, slipped through a gold ring, some
charms in silver and gold: a medal for a good journey
with a figure of St. Christopher; a golden olive, harbinger
of peace; a little bluish-green scarab; another
medal with just a name inscribed and nothing else&mdash;Lilian;
and a small hand on which were engraved some
oriental figures. One by one Lucio for the fourth time
passed these small jewels in review, turning and returning
them between his fingers, seeking to discover
something fresh. Then he set himself to study the last
object which that feminine purse contained.</p>

<p>The last object, the most mysterious and important,
was a little pocket-book of dark blue leather, closed by
a slender silver pencil. Inside, on the first page, was
stuck down a four-leaved clover, a little shamrock that
had been sought for and found in the fields, and after
being dried, had been pasted on the first leaf, and
underneath it in fine letters, firm and long, was the name&mdash;ever
that name&mdash;Lilian. Many of the pages of the
pocket-book were covered with lines of writing, sometimes
in ink, sometimes in pencil. They seemed to be
notes thrown there according to the day and the state
of the soul. Without stirring from his ruined tree trunk,
the dark bark of which was peeling, with his feet amidst
the deep grass and woodland flowers, Lucio re-read
page for page what the unknown Lilian had written in
the pocket-book. A date in English on a page, a date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which went back two years, to December, and still in
English, Portia's exclamation in <em>The Merchant of
Venice</em>: "The world is too heavy for my little body."
Further, still in English, a singular phrase: "One must
wait in hope and faith. <em>Someone</em> will come: surely he
will come." Then, in a medley, the name of a French
or German woman, with some address in Paris or Vienna.
On another page, another character, still feminine, had
written in English a farewell: "Dear, dearest Lilian,
don't forget me; I won't forget you," with a signature&mdash;Ethel.
Lucio Sabini read on with immense attention,
examining the phrases, words, and letters, seeking to
divine even more than they said and showed. In French,
on another page, again in the writing of the mysterious
one, were two questions: "Must one live to love?
Must one die to love?" And at last on the penultimate
page, in a scrawling writing, like a child that is striving
to write something he does not understand, in almost
round letters, was a verse of Dante's, copied with an
orthographical error: "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Amor che a cor gentil ratto si
apprende.</i>"</p>

<p>Each time at these words so vibrant with love's
emotion which the unknown woman's hand had copied
letter for letter, which surely she must have understood
or someone have explained to her; at these words of
the poet Lucio Sabini trembled, charmed as he was by
brief loves encompassed by poesy, because of their
mystery and their brevity.</p>

<p>Now there came the last page, where in haste the
woman had written in pencil in French: "How high
and close to heaven are the mountains! I should like
to return here in winter, to the highest mountain,
amidst the whitest and purest snow...."</p>

<p>There was nothing else. Mechanically Lucio closed
the book, replacing the slender silver pencil. He replaced,
too, the little cambric kerchief, the charms, and the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
book in the purse, thereby stretching the clasp to close
it. For some time, as he pursued his fantasy, he dreamed
of her who had lost that purse, and he saw in his dream
the figures of many ladies who surprised him and looked
at him, who smiled and beckoned to him to follow them,
and each of them, it seemed to him, might be the unknown
Lilian; now dark and handsome, now slender
as a reed, now with eyes sky-blue and smiling, now with
eyes black and languishing.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the air the Dorf clock, blue with gilded
hours, struck ponderously and harmoniously half-past
eleven. The sound spread itself along the lake and
in the woods. Lucio Sabini burst into laughter at his
dream and at himself. Perhaps&mdash;in fact surely&mdash;she
who had lost the purse so full of poetical matter, and
bore the floral name of Lilian, might be an English old
maid, angular, with pince-nez. Lucio laughed at himself
and his dream, which melted in the clear air of that
heavenly morning.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>At midday, before and after luncheon, the telephones
at all the hotels and villas did nothing but ring in
their little cupboards, and in German, English, and
French&mdash;especially in German&mdash;there was an incessant
calling, questioning and answering. The morning that
had spread over the Engadine a sky which seemed a
shimmering mantle of azure silk, and that had given
to the eye an inexplicable brightness, and to every
panting breast a contented appearance, almost as if it
were a strange, sublime potion, had developed into a
splendid afternoon. Men and women who had lazily
passed the morning hours in an hotel room, or in strolling
up and down the nearer meeting-places of the Bad and
Dorf, were seized with a desire of faring forth, away
along the majestic roads and paths and hills&mdash;everywhere
an afternoon could be lived in the open air.</p>

<p>In the hotel halls and drawing-rooms there was a
continual making and organising of plans, a calling up
by telephone of other hotels, coach-hirers, and remote
restaurants up above and tea-rooms, to summon friends
and acquaintances together, to order carriages and
bespeak teas for fifteen and twenty persons. Frau
Mentzel, the exceedingly wealthy Hamburg Jewess&mdash;she
herself was a Dutchwoman, her husband an American,
and her sons had been born in different countries
of the world&mdash;who was unable to live without a court
of ten or fifteen persons at lunch or dinner, and who
could not pass twenty-four hours without changing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dress four times, who threw her money out of the window
and yet always talked about money, and quoted the
price of her clothes and how much the flowers that
adorned her table had cost; Frau Mentzel, courted by
all the parasites of both sexes, telephoned to her friends
from the "Stahlbad," where she was staying, and which
at all hours of the day was filled with the noise of her
train, to come at once, as she was setting out for the
Fexthal glacier to take tea up there, and on every side
the usual parasites said yes; but others, the smart
people, whom Frau Mentzel would have liked to have
had with her, fenced and adduced excuses of other
outings and excursions.</p>

<p>Don Lucio Sabini answered Frau Mentzel at the telephone
that he was unable to come since he was engaged
for tea elsewhere, moreover the Fexthal glacier was
unfortunately too far-off for him to go and look her up.
The beautiful Madame Lawrence, from the "Palace,"
advised all her suitors and a lady friend or two that they
were going in five or six carriages to Maloja, that they
would leave at three, not later, so as to arrive at five
at the Kursaal Maloja; but her lady friends were few,
all more or less insignificant as to physiognomies, dresses
and hats, in order that she should shine like a jewel
among them. Vittorio Lante, who for an evening had
attached himself to the court of the divinity of the year,
excused himself from going to the Maloja; for with a
group of friends he had been invited by Mrs. Clarke to
tea at the Golf Club. Countess Fulvia Gioia telephoned
from the "Victoria" to two of her friends to ask if they
were disposed to walk with her to Pontresina and back,
a walk through the woods of about three hours, but so
pleasant and peaceful amidst the pines, along the white
torrent that descends from the Bernina. Although her
second youth was waning, Countess Fulvia kept her
beauty, preserving her health by living a life of action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ardour, and open air, passing July at the seaside, August
in the mountains, the autumn in the country: so all her
youthful fascination lasted, and that in homage to the
last powerful and profound love which held her completely,
to which she was bound by an indissoluble knot
because it was the last. Of the two friends, the Duchesse
de Langeais, a French woman of her own age, who
treasured her beauty as a precious thing in the half-light,
refused, fearing light, air, and fatigue, lest they should
all discover the invincible traces of age, and fearing lest
certain weaknesses and troubles should be too apparent
after such a walk. The other, Donna Carlotta Albano,
an old lady, who welcomed without sorrow the end of
beauty, youth, and love, as she set herself to love what
remains after love is over, accepted.</p>

<p>From Sils Maria the Misses Ellen and Norah West
telephoned their friend Mabel Clarke to ask if they could
look in at the "Palace" about four o'clock to take her
with them to tea at the "Belvoir," the restaurant half-way
from Pontresina; but smiling at the telephone
Mabel Clarke declared that mamma had invited some
delightful young men to tea with them at the Golf Club,
and that, even so near as they were to St. Moritz, it was
quite impossible that day.</p>

<p>At the Grand Hotel the Spanish lady with the soft
eyebrows painted black, and lips painted red, with
cheeks disappearing beneath a stratum of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">veloutine
Rachel</i>, but in spite of this of a most alluring beauty,
Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s de Fuentes, was torturing herself and
her husband, really to know where the high society of the
Engadine would foregather at tea on that day, and where
she could take a sister and her friend, who had arrived
the day before from Madrid, to show them this high
society. At each different news with which Francis
Mornand, the chronicler of the Engadine, whimsically
furnished her, Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s de Fuentes, restless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
agitated, changed her mind, suffering in every fibre
from her snobbishness.</p>

<p>By two o'clock, and at three and four, the coming and
going, the meeting and disappearing of the large stage-coaches
drawn by four horses and full of gentlemen and
ladies, of large brakes filled with smiling girls and young
men, of landaus drawn by impatient horses, of victorias
with solitary couples, became even more vertiginous.</p>

<p>There was a running greeting from one carriage to
another, a moment's halt to invite each other to set out
together, and a prompt acceptance from someone who
was jumping up into his carriage smiling. There was
a general giving of appointments for dinner and for the
evening, with a gay cry in French, in English, or in
German; there was a cracking of whips, a tinkling of
horses' bells, and sounding of coach horns, and over all
a fluttering of the veils of every colour and shade which
surrounded the ladies' heads.</p>

<p>The carriages descended towards Silvaplana, Sils,
Fexthal, and the Maloja; they ascended towards Pontresina,
the Roseg glacier, and the Morteratch glacier,
towards Samaden and Celerina. The departure of the
five or six carriages of Madame Lawrence towards the
Maloja was impressive. She was in the first in a completely
white costume with face and head enveloped in
a close green veil, but so transparent that the large grey-blue
eyes and the golden hair, strikingly combed into
big tresses, were well discernible.</p>

<p>As for Frau Mentzel's party, her stage-coach and other
equipages had ascended and descended three times from
St. Moritz Bad to St. Moritz Dorf, with a great flourish of
horns, to pick up people, but in reality to attract attention.
However, it was all done so late that they would
never reach the Fexthal glacier, and, at the most, the
restaurant for tea. Still that sufficed.</p>

<p>Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s de Fuentes, as she descended in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
large landau towards the Maloja, experienced a heart-burning
at seeing the equipage of Her Royal Highness,
the reigning Princess of Salm, directed towards "Belvoir,"
where, it seemed, Her Royal Highness had invited
ten or a dozen French, English, German, and Italian
ladies, actually the ten or twelve noblest of the noble.
Also the carriage of Her Royal Highness, the Grand
Duchess of Gotha, was directed up above; but she was
not going to tea. She was going to Celerina, as she did
each day, to visit the great doctor who lived there. The
Grand Duchess was ill, but to deceive herself into feeling
better she went to the doctor daily. And Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s
de Fuentes registered a vow to herself that if ever
she were ill in the Engadine, she would only allow herself
to be healed by the doctor of the Grand Duchess at
Celerina.</p>

<p>A great moral laziness had seized Lucio Sabini on that
second portion of the day. Two or three telephone calls
had invited him to go in gay and amiable society to two
or three different places, and two or three easy excuses
had served him to decline the invitations&mdash;the Roseg
glacier, a boating party on the Lake of the Maloja, a visit
to Friedrich Nietzsche's house at Sils Maria. All were
excuses to meet once more, after a hundred times, people
already known; to talk on the way, without ever
looking where they were passing, of the incidental things
of the day before, and of the days before that, and then
to finish, not before the colossal wall of a glacier, not in
a poetical crossing of a lonely lake amidst the lofty
black mountains, not before a little garden of rose
bushes, geraniums, and yellow marguerites, that the
eyes of the poet of Zarathustra had seen born and perish,
from May to September, at Sils Maria, but at tea-tables
laden with toast, cakes and pastry and plates of confectionery
at the restaurants half-way between the
glaciers, in the smart <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">latterie</i>, in the halls of large hotels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and vestibules of small hotels. "Glaciers, lakes, hills,
large tracts, villages," thought Lucio Sabini, in a bad
temper; "all little excuses to wrap up in a large veil and
drive in a carriage, speaking ill of worthy people and
beautiful things&mdash;and to take tea!"</p>

<p>However, to conquer his attack of misanthropy, after
lunch he went for a stroll along the road, to excuse himself
again to those whose invitation he had refused, to
greet some more sympathetic and elect acquaintance,
and to watch some unknown faces passing, those solitary
faces that attracted him powerfully. What a lot of
people he had seen thus, climbing, descending, and
stopping half-way, and setting out again in the early
hours of the afternoon, as he quietly came and went to
the "Palace" and the "Badruth," stopping and chatting
with everyone, foregathering with some friend just about
to leave, commenting with irony and sometimes with
bitterness on certain bizarre, clamorous and scandalous
events. But still all this giddy worldliness had not excited
him. Gradually he saw everyone he knew and did
not know pass up and down; then a dominant thought,
at first vague and uncertain, afterwards more insistent,
mastered him. At noon, on entering his hotel, at the
porter's box, he had read a notice in German that the
day before a lady's silver purse had been lost in the
gardens near the tennis-court, and it was requested that
the purse should be returned for a reward to the porter
of the HÃ´tel Kulm.</p>

<p>"An hotel for American and English women," he
thought at once. "This Lilian will be a governess of
fifty, with a maroon veil to her hat. She will give me
a dollar for a reward in exchange for her purse." And
he laughed at his little romance.</p>

<p>Moreover, when, through a singular and inexplicable
motive of fastidiousness, he had refused all the invitations
that would have carried him far-away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
HÃ´tel Kulm, and had seen the great crowd set off
gradually, excited by another experience and the life
in the open air, but seated in carriages beneath rugs and
veils; when he found himself alone, he was again conquered
by the desire of finding and knowing her who
had lost the silver purse. He thought himself sometimes
puerile and sometimes downright grotesque. But
he believed in opportunity; so a little later he watched
the simpler, modest, and unknown people set off on foot
through the Alpine paths to the Meierei, to Waldschlossli,
to Oberalpina or Unteralpina, all those who were fond of
walking or could not afford to spend money on carriages,
and he saw them disappear along the roads and lanes,
beneath the trees, or across the tall grass. Towards four
o'clock he observed that the broad roads and paths were
becoming almost deserted, and silence and peace to be
enveloping St. Moritz Bad and St. Moritz Dorf. Then
it was that slowly he took the path that leads from the
central place of the Dorf, where the tram stops, to the
Engadine "Kulm."</p>

<p>He thought: "Probably this Lilian is very ugly; but
surely she has a beautiful soul. What does it matter?
I shall be very polite to her for some minutes."</p>

<p>On arriving at the big door of the "Kulm" he entered
slowly, to make inquiries from the porter, as if it were
of no consequence.</p>

<p>"The person who has lost the silver purse," replied
the porter at once, "is Miss Temple."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lucio, "and is Miss Temple in the
hotel?"</p>

<p>"No, she has gone out for a walk. You can leave the
purse with me."</p>

<p>"No; I would rather return. Do you know where
Miss Temple has gone?"</p>

<p>"She has gone out as usual with her friend, Miss
Ford. I believe they have gone towards Chasselas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Towards Chasselas? Two single ladies? Both
young?" As a matter of fact he waited for the reply
with secret trepidation.</p>

<p>"One is young, the other is not."</p>

<p>And Lucio Sabini, like a boy, or a student, did not
want to, and did not know how to, ask anything else. He
turned his back, left the hotel, and stopping for a moment,
he tried to remember the way that leads from the
Dorf to Chasselas. It was a walk, at a good pace, of
about three-quarters of an hour. He believed in opportunity.
He set out; but he had not walked three
minutes before he met a group of people, one of whom
greeted him with a smile. Mrs. Clarke and Miss Mabel
Clarke were climbing towards the Golf Club accompanied
by various men. The graceful American girl,
with her slender and flexible figure, was walking well
in front, in a light grey dress, her little head crowned
with a hat surrounded by roses, beneath which her
chestnut hair surged in rebellious waves, breaking over
the white forehead and covering the tips of the little
pink ears. Beside her was Don Vittorio Lante della
Scala, and the two were carrying on a friendly and lively
conversation, as they looked and smiled at each other,
Vittorio Lante with sweet and serious eyes, together
with that quick virile smile that is a grace in an Italian
face. Behind came Mrs. Clarke in a very fashionable
and rich dress, certainly too rich to go to tea at the
Golf Club. On her old lace cravat shone a solitary
jewel, to wit, a small thread of gold from which were
hanging, like drops, two enormous emeralds shaped like
pears. On her head was the large hat with the feather
that the more mature American women delight in at all
hours of the day and night. Mrs. Clarke's countenance
was, as usual, calm and inexpressive, with Mabel's fine
features which had become gross and fat. Beside her
was the Marquis de Jouy, a young Frenchman, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
brilliant and witty, full of pretensions, whose fixed idea
was to speak well of all countries save his own, and constantly
to speak ill of France; thereby he thought
himself most original. His latest caprice was for
America and Americans; he sought them out everywhere,
going into ecstasies at every speech and every
act of theirs. There was also the Vicomte di Loewe, a
Belgian, a most ardent and fortunate gambler, who
always attached himself to gamblers of both sexes who
were rich and inexperienced; and two or three other
Austrian and French gentlemen, all more or less courtiers
of the mother or daughter, for diverse objects, but
whose sole magnet as a matter of fact was the Clarke
money.</p>

<p>Lucio Sabini stopped for a moment, as he smiled at
Vittorio Lante: with an expressive glance he questioned,
approved, and congratulated discreetly. With
a single glance Vittorio also answered, thanked, and
hoped discreetly. The two friends understood each other
without any of the bystanders having understood. The
Clarke party pursued its way towards the Golf Club,
while Lucio Sabini set out for the Wald Promenade, a
path that dominates the main road from St. Moritz Dorf
to Campfer, and that guards St. Moritz Bad from on
high amidst the trees. It was a little path now entirely
discovered to view, showing the country down below
with a lake that seemed much smaller, like a silver cup,
beneath a sky that was growing white as the day
declined, now hidden by dense foliage of large bushes and
trees. At that hour in which all had reached their goal,
in which carriages and people were in front of the
restaurants, and in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">latterie</i> and hotel saloons, ladies,
with veils unloosed, were carrying cups of tea to their
lips, while the men were eating buttered toast; in that
declining hour of the day not a soul was traversing the
Wald Promenade. Lucio Sabini hurried, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
smiled at his haste, as he thought that perhaps, no certainly,
he would never meet Miss Lilian Temple and her
friend, who quite likely had not even gone to Chasselas
or had taken another way, or would take another way
thence to return to the Dorf; whom perhaps he would
not recognise as he did not know them, for he could not
ask all the ladies he should meet if they were Miss
Lilian Temple and Miss Ford. But that day&mdash;why, he
knew not&mdash;he believed ever more firmly in Destiny.
Suddenly the path inclined, the trees became scarcer:
the Wald Promenade, the walk in the wood, ended, and
he saw at once that he could not be very far from
Chasselas.</p>

<p>The day continued to decline. Already the sun was
hidden between the two lofty snow peaks, between the
proud Monte Albana and the majestic Julier. Much
further to right and left the more modest heights of the
Polaschin and the gentle Suvretta at that first hour of
sunset had become light and transparent beneath the
pearlish-grey sky. In front of him Lucio saw the broad
road that he had followed parallely, which starts from
the Dorf, incline below, all white behind a promontory,
as it goes towards Campfer. To his right a small, green,
open valley climbed in a pleasant curve, with scarcely
sloping meadows crowned with small hedges and trees,
towards a little group of white houses. To the left a
large grassy bank, leafy and very dense, hid the rumbling
course of the Inn with its rocks, and the road that returned
to St. Moritz Bad. Further below the scene
opened out, giving a glimpse of the little lake of
Campfer with the village nestling on its shore, then a
large tongue of land, and much further still the lake
of Silvaplana, and further off, but imposing with its
two white peaks, was the Margna covered with eternal
snow.</p>

<p>Lucio stood and watched. He remembered now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
those little white houses up there on the ascending little
valley were Chasselas. He looked again, beyond and
around. It was the point where the four roads divide;
in fact the four sign-posts were a little further on, with
their little red flags picked out in white with four inscriptions.
If Miss Temple had gone to Chasselas, and
if she had not already returned thence, she must
pass there. A fountain hard by was singing its little
water song. There was a seat there: he sat down.
Some people passed as they came from Chasselas:
first two Germans, husband and wife, the one in front,
the other behind, with gymnastic step, both red in the
face and taciturn, the wife with a black skirt held up by
some elastic bands; then came a nursemaid who was
hurrying with her two little ones; then no one else.
The day declined.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he looked a little ahead, Lucio perceived
a small white wall encircling a field: a little open gate
joined together the two sides of the small wall. This
little wall was so low that flowers with long stems showed
themselves above it, bright flowers that bent themselves
slightly to the evening wind. He thought that it might
be one of the numerous pretty and flourishing gardens
which surround the little villas and houses of Switzerland;
but he perceived neither villa nor house. Instead
he discovered amidst the clusters of flowers some white
stones. Then he understood that, without seeking for
it, he had found a little cemetery, the little cemetery
of St. Moritz Dorf, far from habitation, perched aloft
behind a wood, a little cemetery all flowery, gracious,
and solitary. Immediately afterwards he saw, along the
wall, two feminine forms leaning over to look at the
modest tombs so well surrounded by groups of little
plants and brightly coloured flowers. The two ladies
were separated from each other by a few paces, and they
were watching silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Temple?" asked Lucio Sabini of the first
lady, taking off his hat.</p>

<p>A serious face already touched by years turned to him.
The lady replied in a low voice:</p>

<p>"No, sir." And turning towards her companion, she
called out in English:</p>

<p>"Darling!"</p>

<p>The other came forward at once.</p>

<p>"Miss Temple?" asked Lucio Sabini again.</p>

<p>The young woman raised her eyes of purest blue,
whence emanated a sweet light; a slight blush coursed
beneath the transparent skin of her virginal face, and
she replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>A long minute of silence followed. The three were
standing near the beautiful, little, solitary cemetery,
where had been sleeping in the high mountains for years,
or months, or days, unknown men, women, and children;
the flowers were hardly bowing over the stones, which
were becoming even whiter in the sunset.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," murmured Lucio, recovering his
composure. "I have to restore you something, Miss
Temple."</p>

<p>"My purse&mdash;really!" she exclaimed, advancing a
little, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>"Here it is, <em>miss</em>."</p>

<p>And drawing the precious object from his pocket he
gave it to Miss Lilian Temple. The beautiful eyes
glanced with sweetness, and the mouth, so perfect,
smiled; the little hand clasped the recovered object, as
if to caress it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," she added.</p>

<p>Then she stretched out the little hand that was free,
gloved in white. He took it lightly and kept it but
for a moment in his own, then he released it with a
deep bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss May Ford, silent, indifferent, strange, waited.
Now all three were silent, while for a long time Lucio
Sabini fixed his eyes on the enchanting face for which
the blond hair made a soft aureole. At last he said, with
a courteous smile:</p>

<p>"Did not Miss Temple promise a reward to whomsoever
brought back her purse?"</p>

<p>The girl, marvelling a little, raised her eyebrows,
questioning the Italian gentleman without speaking.</p>

<p>"Lucio Sabini asks her, as reward, to be allowed to
accompany her now as far as the 'Kulm.'"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied the girl at once in a frank
way. "My dear friend, Miss May Ford, Signor Lucio
Sabini."</p>

<p>The elderly English lady replied with cold courtesy
to the greeting of Don Lucio Sabini. And without
giving another glance to the surrounding country, which
was enveloping itself in the finest tints, from a delicate
violet to the most delicate green, the three withdrew
from the quiet cemetery and proceeded silently along
the broad high road that leads to the Dorf. Lilian
Temple's step was rather quick, and Lucio Sabini
adapted his to the girl's. Miss May Ford went more
slowly.</p>

<p>"Are you glad, Miss Temple, to have found your
purse?" he began to say in his insinuating voice that
in French became even more penetrating.</p>

<p>"So glad: I am very grateful to you, Signor."</p>

<p>"You valued it, then?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was a souvenir, or a gift?" he ventured
to ask, scrutinising those beautiful blue eyes.</p>

<p>But the girl lowered her eyelids; she did not reply.</p>

<p>He understood that he had asked too much; they
were silent for a little.</p>

<p>"Do you know Italy, Miss Temple?" he resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know Italy; not all, though," she replied, again
courteously. "I hope to see it all later on."</p>

<p>"And do you like our country, Miss Temple?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Signor," she murmured, her voice a little veiled.</p>

<p>Again their eyes met and fixed each other for an instant,
as they both walked a little ahead.</p>

<p>"Which city pleased you most, Miss Temple?" he
asked, bending towards her, lowering his voice still
more.</p>

<p>"Florence," she replied.</p>

<p>"Florence; I ought to have guessed it!"</p>

<p>"Why guess it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you write a verse from Dante in your pocket-book?"
he asked, looking fixedly at her.</p>

<p>"Then you read my pocket-book?" she exclaimed,
stopping, confused and hurt.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! Have I done wrong, Miss Temple?"</p>

<p>She bent her head; her mouth became serious and
almost severe, and she hurried her step.</p>

<p>"Have I really done so wrong, Miss Temple?" he
asked, this time with genuine anxiety.</p>

<p>She shook her head without replying; her gentle face
had already become sweet again.</p>

<p>"Anyone would have read that pocket-book, Miss
Temple," he added, quite sadly.</p>

<p>"Not an Englishman, Signor," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That is true, not an Englishman; but an Italian,
yes," he replied. "Our fantasy is as ardent as our
hearts. You must understand us to excuse us, Miss
Temple."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, Signor," she replied seriously,
with a little smile of indulgence. "I know Italy, but
not Italians. If they are as ardent as you say, it no
longer matters having read my pocket-book, Signor."</p>

<p>"And you will pardon an Italian who confesses his
fault, and is very sorry for it?" he asked in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
penetrating tone of his, where always there seemed to
be deep emotion.</p>

<p>Miss Lilian Temple looked at him an instant, furtively.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Signor; I pardon you willingly."</p>

<p>And gracefully, with a spontaneous, youthful gesture,
she again offered him her hand, as if rancour could not
exist in her gentle soul. At such ingenuous kindness the
man, over whose mind had passed such fearful tempests,
leaving their ineffaceable traces, felt a tremor of complacency,
as he pressed that little hand, which was given
him without hesitation and so sincerely.</p>

<p>It grew darker. A pungent breath of wind arose,
whirling and causing the trees to rustle. The two ladies
wanted to put on their coats, which up to then they had
carried on their arms, and Lucio performed the gallant
duty of helping both of them, then he exchanged some
words with Miss May Ford, the elderly lady who kept
silent with such English dignity.</p>

<p>He, however, with his constant desire of conquest,
instead of returning her speech in French, as he had
done with Miss Temple, had the politeness to speak in
English, a tongue that he spoke slowly, but with certainty
and some elegance.</p>

<p>Upon the rather severe and purposely impassive face
of Miss Ford, there appeared for the first time a gracious
expression. Now the three walked together, Lucio
having Miss Ford on his right and Lilian Temple on the
other side of her friend: all three talked English. A
sudden wind that was becoming rough revolved in
whirling circles. On the road by which they were pursuing
their return, and on which they still more hurried
their steps, there was a continuous returning of all the
equipages which three hours previously had left the
Dorf for Sils, Fexthal, the Maloja, and which to get
home more quickly were returning at a lively trot from
the Campfer road towards the Dorf. In the carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the women had put on their large, dark cloaks, and the
white and light dresses of the early hours of the afternoon,
all joyous in the sun, had vanished: cold and
silent, they wrapped themselves in their cloaks. Some
had buried their necks in thick fur stoles, and the
large, flowing veils had been closed round the hats, and
tied round the neck in ample knots, like large handkerchiefs
or scarves.</p>

<p>The men had put on their overcoats, raising the collars,
and they had lowered the flaps of their soft felt hats. In
many of the carriages the broad rugs, some white and
soft, others striped like tiger skins, had been spread. On
all who were returning there was seemingly a feeling of
weariness. The women lolled well back in the seats of
the carriage, some with the head thrown back a little as
if to repose, others with bowed forehead, but all were
silent, with their white-gloved hands lost in the large
sleeves of their cloaks or hidden beneath the carriage
rug; the men had that air of weariness and boredom
that ages the physiognomy of the youngest. All were
weary through having once again chattered vainly of
vain things, through having flirted with trite and cold
words, with accustomed and banal actions; they were
tired of all this, but without wishing to confess it and
attributing their weariness to the open air, in which they
were unaccustomed to live for so many hours. They
were ready, when they had passed along the road
now beaten by the strong, gelid evening wind, and had
reached the warmth of their hotels, amidst the shining
lights, to resume the same conversations, and begin again
the same flirtations, till the night was advanced.</p>

<p>Now all were silent and bored: the women were
almost pallid beneath their veils, the tints of which were
becoming uniform in the rapidly increasing dusk.</p>

<p>The men, no longer gracious, were glad to be silent,
being desirous of arriving quickly at their hotels. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they passed at a brisk trot, and the three wayfarers had
repeatedly to avoid them. Suddenly the carriage of
Madame Lawrence, that year's beauty, passed, followed
by four or five others. She had placed over her white
dress a large, round cloak without sleeves, of a very dark
red cloth, and to be original she had taken off the immense
hat covered with a large green veil, and had drawn
over her head the dark red hood trimmed with old silver
lace. From the back of this hood appeared her calm
and thoughtful beauty, the large eyes, clear and penetrating,
gleamed, and the blond tresses, braided round
the head in Florentine fashion, caused her in that red
cloak, so like a soldier's tunic of olden times, and
beneath that hood, to look like the woman whom the
Italian poet loved. Miss Temple followed her with a
long stare and then glanced at Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>"Do you like Madame Lawrence?" asked Miss Ford.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful; but I don't like her," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Temple.</p>

<p>"I prefer the violets," replied Lucio, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Violets, Signor?" again questioned the girl.</p>

<p>"The modest beauties, Miss Temple. The beauties
who hide themselves."</p>

<p>"Ah," she replied, without further remark.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the "Kulm," when a group
of four men came towards them on foot. They emerge
from a path that tortuously descends and re-climbs a
small valley towards the end of the village. They were
Don Giovanni Vergas, an Italian gentleman of a great
Southern family, seventy years of age, with a still lively
physiognomy, in spite of a fine, correctly cut white
beard; Monsieur Jean Morel, a Frenchman, a Parisian,
an old man of eighty, slender of figure, shrivelled and
upright, with a clean-shaven face, furrowed with a
thousand wrinkles, but on which physical strength was
still to be read; Herr Otto von Raabe, a German from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Berlin, a man of forty, tall, bony, and imposing, with a
brown and haggard face, a little black, bristling beard,
streaked with white, and two blue eyes, blue as blue-bottle
flowers and the sky, and finally Massimo Granata,
a Southern Italian, with a thin, yellowish face that could
never have known youth, with a body all twisted with
the rickets. He was already advanced in years, and
invalided by a long, slow, incurable disease; his glance
scintillated with goodness and intelligence, and a dreamy
expression was in all his countenance.</p>

<p>The well-cut boots of Don Giovanni Vergas and the
Parisian, Jean Morel, were covered with dust, as also
were the big stout boots of Otto von Raabe and Massimo
Granata. All four, in costume and bearing, had the
appearance of having walked far. The German carried
a large bundle of Alpine flowers, formed of wild
geraniums, fine and rosy, bluebells long of stalk, and
tall green grasses streaked with white, and his face every
now and then was bent over the mountain flowers.
Massimo Granata pressed to his bosom a bunch of
gentians, some dark, some light, of a dark and pale
violet, and of a violet-blue. The meeting with the four
was for a moment only: their words were rapid and
joyous.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>"On high, on high," exclaimed Jean Morel vivaciously.</p>

<p>"To the Alp Nova," replied Don Giovanni Vergas,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Four hours climbing and descending," continued
Otto von Raabe, with a very German guttural accent,
and a kind smile on his large mouth.</p>

<p>"And we have all these beautiful flowers, Sabini, these
beautiful gentians," concluded Massimo Granata, as if
in a dream.</p>

<p>They greeted each other and vanished. Lucio followed
them for a moment with his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"They do not come from a restaurant," he murmured,
as if to himself.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Signor?" asked Miss Temple,
looking at him with her beautiful eyes that questioned
so ingenuously.</p>

<p>"These friends of mine, Miss Temple, have all of
them been far on high to-day, all of them, even the
oldest and the invalid."</p>

<p>He spoke as in a dream, in the evening that had
already fallen.</p>

<p>"And they gathered those blue and violet flowers,"
added Miss Temple, thoughtfully and dreamily.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"The mountain flowers are so beautiful," continued
the English girl; "and the mountains themselves are so
near to heaven."</p>

<p>"Would you like to climb up there, Miss Temple?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Signor; even where there are no flowers, even
where there are only rocks and eternal snows," she added
mysteriously, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>That white, cold, pure vision remained in her beautiful
eyes when she took leave of Lucio Sabini and disappeared
with her friend into the hall of the HÃ´tel Kulm. Alone,
in the dark evening, he was surrounded by the cold wind,
and all his soul was invaded by an unknown, inexplicable,
and mortal sadness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>"May I come in, mamma?" asked the fresh, sonorous
voice of Mabel Clarke at the closed door.</p>

<p>"Come in, dearie," replied the soft and expressionless
voice of her mother from within.</p>

<p>Mabel entered and with her eyes sought her mother
in the spacious room.</p>

<p>"I am here, dearie," murmured her mother, even
more softly. Annie Clarke lay stretched upon a large
sofa that filled up a whole corner of the room; her head,
which had been carefully dressed and the hair passed
discreetly through henna, was leaning in a tired way on
a pillow of oriental stuff covered with quaint, old lace.
A pure white bear-skin, stretched over her knees,
covered the edge of the sofa and fell on the ground like
a soft white carpet. Around Annie Clarke, on the great
bear-skin, on a table beside her, on little tables placed
within her reach, were a hundred different objects; a
writing-case with everything necessary for writing, a
row of flasks and little bottles for salts, scents, and
medicines; bundles of unopened reviews, bundles of
uncut books, manicure-case, silver and gold boxes of all
dimensions for cipria, pastes and pins; paper-knives,
another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nÃ©cessaire</i> for opening letters, a large glass filled
with a milky drink, wherein was immersed a golden
spoon, and close to her right hand was a silver-gilt pear
studded with turquoises&mdash;the electric bell. But Annie
Clarke performed none of these operations, since Mrs.
Broughton or Fanny, the trusted maid, before leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
her had gathered around her whatever might be useful
to her. There was Annie Clarke, impassive, tranquil;
not sad, not happy, perhaps not even thoughtful. On
the third finger of her right hand shone an enormous
diamond, a most rare jewel; but she wore no other
jewels. With a smile Mabel Clarke drew near her mother
and bent her head over her. Annie gave a fleeting kiss
to her daughter's flowing, rebellious locks, and then
offered a smooth and expressionless cheek to be kissed.</p>

<p>"How are you, mammy?"</p>

<p>"I am cold, dearie."</p>

<p>"Cold?"</p>

<p>"Very cold."</p>

<p>Mabel threw a glance at the broad window that almost
cut off one of the walls of that room in the "Palace,"
and which looked out over the lake. In the peculiar
frame of light wood which the opened shutters formed
and that really seemed like the frame of a vast picture,
behind the shining windows, right opposite there was
to be seen, but extraordinarily near, a huge mass of the
deepest green, the dense wood of Acla Silva, which no
house or cottage disturbs. Over the virgin wood a fringe
of brightest, almost shimmering blue&mdash;the sky; beneath
the wood a fringe of steel-blue, motionless and
scintillating&mdash;the lake. And everything was enveloped
and penetrated by the purest light.</p>

<p>"The weather is so beautiful," added Mabel in a
harmonious voice. "You are cold because you do not
go out."</p>

<p>"I am not a <em>sport</em> like you, Mabel. You know that,"
exclaimed Annie, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, que j'adore ce pays!</i>" exclaimed the beautiful
girl suddenly in French, with a strong American accent;
and the exclamation bubbled forth like a cry of joy, as
she smiled delightfully.</p>

<p>"You are right," murmured her mother tranquilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Full of joy, Mabel Clarke's large grey eyes, the large
enchanting eyes of an almost infantile grey, rested in
rapture upon the bright window, where the landscape
appeared strangely circumscribed, formed by the immaculate
and intense green of the wood, the pureness
of the sky, and motionless waters, while the wood, sky,
and lake were wrapped in light. Mabel's tall and comely
figure and every line and feature of the graceful face
breathed youth, serenity, and joy of living. Instead of
one of her usual tailor-made dresses, from the round
skirts of which were always to be seen the long, well-booted
feet, the jacket a little long and angular, allowing
one to guess at the flexible lines of her figure, she wore
a dress of white cambric, of French style, all fringed and
inserted with lace, a soft, rather long dress, with a sash
of ivory silk. On her head, instead of one of those round
hats with straight brim and a feather like a dagger
which completes the Anglo-American tailor-made dress,
she wore a large coif hat, trimmed with white cambric,
the coif of Charlotte Corday, tied with a sky-blue ribbon,
with a large bow at the side. Her parasol and shoes
were white, as were her gloves and purse.</p>

<p>"You look very nice, Mabel," said her mother, after
gazing and smiling an instant at her dear daughter's
figure in the white dress.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour le bon Dieu, chÃ¨re maman</i>," exclaimed the
daughter, smiling, and showing her white teeth.</p>

<p>"Are you going to collect in church this morning,
dearie? Did you accept, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! How can one say no to the Archduchess?
She takes such an interest in the Catholic
church."</p>

<p>"So do we, Mabel; in fact in all Catholic churches.
And we are very interested in the Pope!" Annie added
with some vivacity. "Did you tell the Archduchess
that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I told her."</p>

<p>"Is the Archduchess Vittoria to collect with you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!"</p>

<p>"Try to collect more money than she does, Mabel."</p>

<p>"I will try to. Won't you give me something, too,
in church?"</p>

<p>"I am not going, dearie. I am tired and cold. I will
give it you now and you shall place the money in your
plate."</p>

<p>Feeling on the large sofa Annie Clarke found her
cheque-book, and drew out her gold pen. Mechanically,
on her knees, she wrote a figure on a cheque, almost
without looking, signed it, detached the leaf lightly,
and, after blotting it, gave it to her daughter.</p>

<p>"Four hundred dollars, Mabel. But there are few
rich Catholics here. All the rich people are Jews,"
murmured Annie Clarke, with a disparaging sneer.
"Shall you collect alone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; each of us has a companion."</p>

<p>"Who accompanies the Archduchess Vittoria?"</p>

<p>"Comte de Roy, the little Count."</p>

<p>"And you? Don Vittorio Lante, I suppose, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied the girl frankly.</p>

<p>"You are very much in love with him, it seems to
me, Mabel."</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"He is a nice young man," said Annie Clarke, in a
low voice; "I believe he has no fortune."</p>

<p>"I believe so, too, mammy."</p>

<p>"Have you already obtained information about
that?"</p>

<p>"No, mammy, I have had no information about it,"
said the girl discreetly, "but I suppose it."</p>

<p>They spoke quietly, looking each other in the eyes,
without a shadow of hesitation in voice or words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you already engaged to him, Mabel?" Annie
Clarke asked, after a minute's silence.</p>

<p>The bright face, where so much youthful beauty
smiled, became, as it were, veiled by a very light cloud,
which disappeared at once.</p>

<p>"Not yet," the girl replied.</p>

<p>"However, you could tie yourself?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could," replied the girl thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Don't do it without warning me, Mabel, my dear."</p>

<p>"Of course I will not do so without warning you,"
said the daughter.</p>

<p>Again the rosy face beneath the large white coif,
beneath the rebellious chestnut hair, bent to kiss the
maternal cheek. Annie Clarke contented herself with
giving a little tap of the hand on her daughter's shoulder,
as an apology for a caress, and followed her with her
eyes as she withdrew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>In the Catholic church of St. Moritz Bad the first
Mass on a Sunday is said at six. The bell of the
rather lofty tower sounded the call to the faithful once
only, and feebly, as if a discreet hand measured the
sound at that early morning hour. The valley was full
of a fleeting white mist that concealed the mountains
far and near, that billowed over the large, deserted
meadows near the church, rendering their grass soft
with water and glistening with flowers; it billowed
amidst the large hotels, closed and silent, and in the
deserted and silent streets of the Bad. The sun, which
much later would cause the white morning mist of the
Engadine to vanish, had not yet emerged from behind
the quaint Piz Languard. The cold was keen and the
atmosphere of an equal shade, greyish white and very
soft.</p>

<p>Slowly, but continuously, the church filled from top
to bottom, in its great central nave and two side aisles,
which are really two long and straight corridors, with a
taciturn, cautious, and respectful congregation of the
faithful. They were the Engadine villagers and woodmen,
men and women in their Sunday clothes, all of
which were dark, in heavy grey cloth, maroon, and deep
blue: the women with head hidden in a dark kerchief,
faces with an opaque colouring, warmed with red,
crowned with chestnut hair with streaks of lightish red,
eyes of a milky blue, very pale and without gleam.
There were labourers from all the railway, street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
house works which they were constructing in the neighbourhood,
in the near and far distance. There were
people of other districts and climes, who every Sunday,
even in winter, over snow and ice, walked mile upon
mile to come and hear Mass, and who even now, in
summer, had put up with great inconvenience to reach
St. Moritz Bad at six in the morning, afterwards to
depart again immediately. There were Lombards,
Venetians, Romagnians, and Calabrians; workmen in
their clean clothes and large boots who bowed to the
altar with the usual act of homage of their own districts
and far-off villages, and who went to seat themselves
by the villagers in profound silence, neither greeting
nor speaking, and like the countrymen and woodmen
on the benches in front, bending their heads at once to
pray.</p>

<p>There were men and women of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, assistants
at the bazaars, who had not yet opened their
shops, saleswomen at the curiosity shops, chambermaids
from the hotels, little players in the orchestra, washerwomen,
starchers, seamstresses, domestic servants of
employers who would still sleep deeply for two or three
hours; all workers, in fact, who had risen so early to be
able to assist at the Mass, since later, at the second Mass
at eight, the work would already have begun in its
briskness and intensity; while at eleven, the hour of
High Mass, none of them would have an instant more
of liberty. Even all these toilers of the luxury, pleasure,
and intoxication of life, these humble, unknown workers
were there in cast-off clothes, with faces still pale from
interrupted sleep, with the tired air of those who are
deprived of rest; but each of them stood at his place in
church, without troubling about his neighbour, seized
by the intimate need of that moment of recollection and
liberty of spirit.</p>

<p>The Mass of the country people, workers, and servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
proceeded in perfect simplicity and great rapidity. It
was said by one of the three priests who compose the
summer Mission of St. Moritz Bad, which comes from
Coire, sent by the Bishop every year in the month of
May to remain there till the end of September. He was
the least known of the three priests, since the chief one
reserved for himself the eleven o'clock Mass, in which
he could speak to the varied cosmopolitan society.
Before the Gospel the organ played ponderously, but
only for a brief space, and there was no singing. Interrupting
the Mass as usual, the celebrant climbed the
pulpit very hurriedly, and after an instant of silent
prayer, he explained that Sunday's Gospel, in which he
spoke of the parable of the good servant, that is of time
that one must place to good use for the welfare of the
Christian soul, and of which the Lord later would demand
strict account.</p>

<p>In truth, villagers, workmen, servants, and workers
of every class listened with immense attention, without
almost moving an eyebrow, to the severe words, too
severely commented upon, about the <em>use of time</em>; and
here and there on many faces there were traces of old
and daily fatigues, traces of old and daily privations,
there seemed to be an anxiety and a fear of not having
worked enough, of not having suffered enough. Here
and there some faces appeared to be inundated with
sadness, so that when the priest finished the commentary
on the day's Gospel with a hasty benediction, they were
bowed full of compunction on the benches. Lower down
some women, in the shade, hid their faces in their hands
to pray, and showed only their bent shoulders in their
modest black wove dresses. When the first tinkling of
the bell announced that the moving mystery of the Host
was beginning, there was a great movement in the church.
The seats and benches were moved, for there was not a
single one of these villagers, work people, and servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
who did not bow the knee before the mystic majesty of
that which was about to happen. And when the triple
tinkling of the bell and the sound of the organ announced
that the mystery was at its culmination of beatitude,
there were nothing but prostrate bodies and prone heads
in the Catholic church of St. Moritz Bad.</p>

<p>But at the end of the Gospel, explained from the
pulpit, the celebrant had added a few words that they
should give alms to the church. The faithful were
reminded that many years ago there was not a shadow
of a Catholic church in the valley, and that to get a
Mass they had been forced to make an even more
fatiguing and severe walk in winter and summer; that
the Catholic church had been built, that it had so many
debts that the good children ought to give something
to alleviate these obligations. During the second
Gospel, a workman rose from his place, crossed himself
before approaching the altar, and taking a bronze plate,
began to make the collection, person by person. Before
offering the plate he searched in his pocket and gave
his offering, an Italian coin of twenty centesimi&mdash;a
nickel. With lowered eyes he quietly offered the plate
to the other workers, peasants, servants, chambermaids,
and domestics. Each gave with lowered eyes five or
ten centimes in Italian, French, or Swiss money. Each
gave not more than a soldo or two, but soon the plate
was full of this heavy money, come from all those poor
pockets of poor men and women who felt the benefit of
having a church every Sunday, to pray and tell God
how great was their sorrow; so they wished to give their
obol to their church.</p>

<p>The workman who was collecting, a Calabrian with a
huge silver watch-chain, and a waistcoat of maroon
velvet, explored even the two side corridors, in the
most obscure corners, and tenaciously asked of each.
Then after a profound genuflexion to the altar he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the sacristy to deposit the collection of all the poor
people. The Mass ended without other music than the
two pieces which had accompanied the first Gospel and
the Elevation. After a moment of hesitation, crossing
themselves broadly towards the altar, the people began
to leave the church, still in silence, and some before
leaving genuflected again. They formed no groups and
clusters to chatter in front of the church, by the swift
river which gaily runs to precipitate itself into the lake.
Everybody left by the central path along the Inn, the
peasants and work people with slow, equal, heavy step;
the servants, chambermaids, toilers of the hotels, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cafÃ©s</i>,
and restaurants with a lighter and more rapid step.
The white, dense Engadine mist had in the meantime
become less dense and was brightened by a light of
interior gold. The sun gradually appeared behind Piz
Languard, and all the atmosphere grew lighter and still
more soft. The air was keenly cold, the soft meadows
covered with flowers which led to the Bad were deserted,
the shops and the windows and balconies of the hotels
were closed; and once more the roads were deserted
when the peasants and workers and servants from every
part had vanished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bell for High Mass, the eleven o'clock Mass, in the
Catholic church at St. Moritz Bad rings three times to
warn the faithful, at half-past ten, at a quarter to eleven,
and at eleven. It is a proud and resounding peal that
fills the fine Engadine air with its harmonies, now heavy,
now sharp. The sonorous summons spreads itself afar
in every part, to the highest villas, and to the most
remote and solitary houses where anyone may be, so
that he may turn his steps and hurry to church. At the
first peal as yet no one appears along the level white
paths amidst the vast green meadows, where the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
rises which, all rude with its unpainted walls, still has
a deserted and empty appearance, and which is situated
in such a way that its foundations seem to be immersed
in the still waters of the lake, where the swift and blue
little Inn beats on one side as it rushes to precipitate
itself into the lake. The belfry, so imposing that it
almost overwhelms the church, trembles in vain from
a peal that invokes the presence of the faithful. But at
the second call slowly from every part, beneath a sun
that makes the whole countryside irresistibly bright
and gay, pass men, women, and children who are descending
towards the church which, through an optical
illusion, almost appears to be suspended above the clear
waters of the lake. Continually from every part people
arrive, now following the noisy course of the merry little
Inn, now crossing it by the bridge, now arriving by the
broad white ribbon, the road from the station and from
St. Moritz Dorf to St. Moritz Bad. Now from the narrow
white byways which descend abruptly amidst the verdure
from the Dorf to the Bad, people keep arriving
and group themselves in the small square before the
church, and beneath the narrow portico with its slender
little pillars, which seem to have been squashed out of
the roof, waiting, chatting, and laughing&mdash;men, women,
and children. All the women's dresses are for the most
part brightly coloured or white, in cambric or fine cloth;
also the children are dressed in white, and beneath their
large hats their long hair appears on their shoulders in
ringlets or waves. Some of the men are dressed fashionably,
others with great simplicity. The crowd that is
gradually formed outside and within the church, exquisitely
dressed and adorned as if for the smartest
society gathering, meets and greets, chatters and smiles,
while but a single word circulates above the conversation,
sometimes softly, sometimes aloud&mdash;respectfully, discreetly,
curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The Archduchess! The Archduchess! The Archduchess!</p>

<p>The Archduchess Maria Annunziata of Austria
entered the church at the first stroke of the second
summons, and crossed it completely with her rather
rigid step. She was very tall and thin in her black
dress, beneath a black hat which rested upon the thick
white frame of her beautiful hair, while a very fine black
veil scarcely threw a shadow on the face pale as ivory,
on the black eyes, of a black as dense as coal, and the
mouth pale as the pink of a withered rose. Maria Annunziata,
Archduchess of Austria, quickly finds her
place, because near the High Altar, more advanced than
any other seat, are two arm-chairs of carved wood and
two dark praying-stools, also of worked wood. The
pious Austrian of the House of Hapsburg at once knelt
down and began to pray. Her niece, a young girl of
fifteen, the Archduchess Maria Vittoria, followed her
into church step for step: already tall and slim, the
young girl had the serene and proud face of the ladies
of the Royal House. Maria Vittoria is very pale of
countenance, and a large tress of very black hair descends
upon her shoulders, which is tied with a bow of white
ribbon. Her eyes are very black, without gleam, and
proud; her eyelids are often lowered, and with her long
eyelashes they throw a shadow on her neck; her fresh
mouth has a prominent lower lip that augments the
pride of the face. The handsome, faded aunt and the
beautiful, quiet, and proud niece are very like each
other.</p>

<p>Maria Vittoria is the only child by the first marriage
of the Archduke Ludwig Salvator and the Archduchess
Maria Immacolata, who had died tragically six years
previously, from a fall from her horse, leaving the child
of nine and a husband who did not weep for her, seeing
that he had been separated from her and was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
living with a friend of hers, the Countess Margaret von
Wollemberg, who, for that matter, he had at once
married morganatically, renouncing every eventual right
to the Austrian throne, renouncing the Court, and even
renouncing the right to see his daughter, Maria Vittoria.</p>

<p>Aunt and niece resemble each other. No one knows
or remembers the old drama that saddened the youth
of Maria Annunziata, and vowed her to celibacy and
placed on her breast, on her black dress, the cross of an
honorary abbess of a convent of Hungarian ladies. In
spite of her deep religious piety, perhaps she still suffers;
but on her face there is no trace of sorrow; there rests
there composure and almost serenity. However, all
know the atrocious doubt that fluctuates over the life
of Maria Vittoria, to wit, that her mother did not die
from an accident, but was killed, and all know of the
father's desertion, that left her under the protection of
her uncles and her aunt, like the most wretched among
orphans of the people. But in Maria Vittoria's silence
there is an immense pride, even when she kneels, as she
bows her head beneath its rich black tresses.</p>

<p>Behind them the Catholic church is almost full, and
by eleven o'clock it is fuller than it has ever been. For
the past week among the Catholic ladies of Italy, France,
and Austria a rumour has said that the Archduchess
Maria Annunziata would attend High Mass at the
Catholic church of St. Moritz Bad instead of hearing
Mass by her chaplain at her Villa Silvana, as usual on
Sundays, because she was interested in the church and
wished people to come and make a large collection in aid
of its necessities; that she had permitted her niece, the
Archduchess Maria Vittoria, to make the collection, and
that even she had condescended to beg Miss Mabel
Clarke, the beautiful and rich American girl&mdash;the girl
of twenty, thirty, fifty millions dowry, the girl at whom
all pointed, whom all wished to know, to whom each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one was anxious to be presented, and whom a hundred
dowry-hunters sought in vain to conquer&mdash;to make the
collection on that day with her niece&mdash;a Royal Princess,
the niece and cousin of a King. Maria Vittoria of Austria
and Mabel Clarke, the daughter of one of the many
millionaires of Fifth Avenue, were to collect together!
The church was fuller than ever it had been. At the
offertory Lidia Smolenska, a Pole with a magnificent
voice, was to sing, who never sang in public, and who
had consented to do so in church through generosity of
mind, although she was of a schismatic religion. Afterwards
Comte AndrÃ© de Beauregard was to sing, a Frenchman
of a great family, absolutely poor, with a treasure
in his throat, who, however, dared not go on the stage,
out of regard for his ancestors.</p>

<p>So the Catholic church of St. Moritz Bad, where every
Sunday the ranks of the faithful are very thin at High
Mass, when the two or three English Protestant churches
are at the same time full to overflowing for Divine
Service, when the Lutheran and Calvinist churches are
crowded with Germans and Swiss psalmodising, when
in the hotels, villas, and houses every Sunday at the
same hour there remains the great Engadine crowd, to
wit the great mass of Jews, this poor little Catholic
church of St. Moritz Bad, which is always half empty&mdash;so
few were the Catholics in the valley and so few the
observing Catholics&mdash;on this Sunday is most full.</p>

<p>French women of the old style have descended from
the Dorf and come from the Bad, drawn by the summons
of the Archduchess of Austria: the septuagenarian
Duchesse d'ArmaillÃ©, whose coquetry it is to affect old
age, while her ancient fascination renews itself, as in a
pleasant twilight of grace; the Duchesse di Langeais,
who is a perfect prodigy of preservation as to beauty
and figure at her uncertain age between forty and forty-five,
laced in a dress that models her like a statue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
moreover is still flexible; la Comtesse de la FertÃ© Guyon,
very pale, blond, bloodless, as if discreet shadows had
spread over her person and attenuated her voice; but
she was still shut up in her incurable melancholy as in a
tower of ivory; the Marquise di Fleury, septuagenarian,
implacably septuagenarian, beneath her yellow hair-dye,
beneath the bistre of her expressionless eyes, beneath
the rouge of her feeble cheeks and her stained lips,
dressed outrageously in white, with a hat of flowers and
no veil; and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande bourgeoise</i>, Madame Lesnay,
whose talent, knowledge of life, and fortune had settled
her sons and daughter in marriage with the noblest
houses of France, and the other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande bourgeoise</i>,
Madame Soffre, who had given two millions to her
daughter so that she could marry the most eminent
young French politician, to make of this daughter a
future President's wife of the Republic. Many French
girls had come there through a deep sense of curiosity
and sadness to assist at the triumph of the American
girl, one of those many girls who nowadays take away
the lovers and husbands from the daughters of French
aristocratic society.</p>

<p>From Dorf and Bad the Italian women had come to
church, those who most frequent every Sunday the two
Catholic churches; also those have come who have heard
the Mass at eight, as they wish to please the Archduchess:
Lombard Marchionesses, tall, thin, with long
necks, long and expressive faces, of a type a little equine,
but with inborn lordly air, with toilettes rather severe,
or absolutely eccentric; magnificent Roman Duchesses,
with delicate faces like finely cut medals, large, proud
eyes, flowing tresses, and of noble bearing; Princesses
of the Two Sicilies, Naples and Palermo, some of rare
and penetrating oriental beauty, with languishing and
rather ardent eyes. All these Italian ladies are accompanied
by their husbands, especially preceded or followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
by sons and daughters, young men or maidens, or children,
boys and girls, three, four, or five, some as beautiful
as the sun, forming admirable groups of freshness,
laughter, and grace. These Italian women among their
children have a protecting, maternal air which if it does
not wholly destroy their womanly fascination, at least
attenuates or straitens and transforms it: while the
French women also in church, even when praying or
bowing their white foreheads on their hands, preserve
all their womanly fascination. There is an enchanting
smile on the mouths of the French women, young,
middle-aged, and old, that mingles even with the light
movement of the lips as they pray, as if they wish to
conquer <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le bon Dieu</i>&mdash;as they always succeed in doing!</p>

<p>All the great Austrian ladies are here at the command
of the Archduchess: the vivacious Hungarian, the
Countess of Durckheim, celebrated for the extravagance
of her life, but ever admired and loved in spite of it all;
the Prinzessin von Sudenhorst, the great ambassadress,
who had done so much for Austria and her husband, and
who afterwards destroyed his fortune by publishing his
memoirs, full of scandalous revelations and a spirit of
cruelty against everyone; the most beautiful woman
in Vienna, Frau Lehman, who was very rich since she
was the wife of the most powerful brewer; the most
beautiful girl in Vienna, FrÃ¤ulein Sophie Zeller. Both
maid and matron were very fair and rosy, with smiling
eyes and large mouths, but slightly awkward in features
and in dress, pretentious under an air of simplicity,
though still quite pleasing. Beneath the shadow of the
Archduchess was her great conquest, the young Baroness
de Sluka, kneeling and praying, who a year ago was
only a distinguished Jewess, Aline Kahn, but who by
means of the Archduchess had been converted with
great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã©clat</i>: she had supported her at her baptism, and
had also given her the title of Baroness, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
neophyte had given a million to the Convent of the
Annunciation, where she was baptised. On her knees,
at the Archduchess's shoulder, the beautiful Baronin
humbly bows her head and prays with exaggerated
ardour, reading from a rich missal, covered with antique
silver, with a book-marker of red ribbon and pious gold
medals.</p>

<p>The American Catholic ladies are in a large group,
almost all standing. The <em>very Catholic</em> are all more or
less in short, tailor-made dresses with hats garnished
with straight feathers. Nearly all are <em>misses</em> captained
by Mabel Clarke's two dearest friends, who have come
specially on horseback from Sils Maria to assist at the
triumph of <em>darling Mabel</em>. The two horses of the West
girls are in a corner of the church square, held by a
groom who has tethered his horse to a paling.</p>

<p>The Mass begins.</p>

<p>"Two hundred millions dowry!" exclaims in a low
voice, sighing vainly, the Vicomte de Lynen, a Belgian,
after looking at the group, an unfortunate, but withal
obstinate hunter after a dowry.</p>

<p>Around him, at the back of the church, there are other
seekers after dowries, as if attracted together by a
secret common desire. Come from Brussels, Paris,
Florence, and everywhere, some spurred by a real need
of readjusting their lives, others only to increase their
luxury and their pleasures. Lynen is, as it were, their
leader, and all of them, more or less young, some of them
of grand name, all very fashionable, assume a sceptical
air, that covers well their hidden interest. And in
mountain clothes of great variety, from that of jacket
and knickerbockers to white tennis flannels, from dark
and subdued suits to the peculiar velvet of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</i>,
nearly all preserve the ingenuous and disinterested
attitude of him who thinks only of enjoying life. Other
men are scattered here and there, come at the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of a lady whom they strive to obey, come to seek one
who is escaping them, or come through duty and
curiosity; of every nation and condition, come as to a
curious spectacle, as to a worldly invitation, to see the
singular partnership of the Archduchess Maria Vittoria
collecting with Mabel Clarke, to hear the two singers who
so seldom allow themselves to be heard, the Smolenska,
who is, in fact, a political exile, and who was consenting,
schismatic as she was, to sing for the Roman Catholic
church, and AndrÃ© de Beauregard&mdash;AndrÃ© whom the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">impresarii</i> of New York were offering fantastic sums to
make of him a rival to Caruso&mdash;while he was contemplating
with melancholy the portrait of his ancestor
slain at Malplaquet, or of another ancestor who was
covered with glory at Fontenoy against the English.
Nearly all the men are standing: there are no more
seats. The caretaker of seats had his plate filled to overflowing
with coins, such as he has never seen before.
Standing, the men look around and turn every now and
then, striving to discern who is entering and to distinguish
which ladies are immersed in the gloom of the
two narrow side aisles, and the mystery of certain veils
which are too close.</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame Lawrence is not here! Then is it
true that she is a Jewess, though she won't confess
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no, she hurt her foot playing golf yesterday."</p>

<p>"But is she a Jewess?"</p>

<p>The Mass begins.</p>

<p>Mabel Clarke had entered a minute previously, dressed
completely in white, her fresh, youthful face suffused
with blushes beneath the white frame of her hat trimmed
with cambric, which the dense mass of her hair raised
and pressed back a little; she carried a soft bunch of
white lilies-of-the-valley in one hand. Her mother is not
with her, nor is the faithful shadow of Mrs. Broughton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
She is accompanied by Don Vittorio Lante della Scala,
who follows her step for step. Dressed in a dark
blue suit, almost black, with the single bright and soft
note of a pale yellow tie, in his sober smartness the
young Italian aristocrat has a virile fascination together
with delicacy and grace. As the two advance silently,
but calmly and easily, their passage forward raises a
murmur that creeps gradually through all the congregation.</p>

<p>Mabel Clarke, who is almost always used to hearing
these whisperings on her passage, does not turn and has
the appearance of not noticing them. Don Vittorio
Lante seems to neither hear nor see, being intent on
every action of the American girl he is accompanying.
Mabel greets her American friends with a slight wave
of the hand and a delightful smile, and reaching the top
of the church looks for a place behind the two Archduchesses.</p>

<p>With difficulty she obtains a seat, and kneels for a
moment. Vittorio Lante places himself most faithfully
beside her, and they are shoulder to shoulder. While
the priest at the altar makes the first genuflexion and
whispers the first prayers, Mabel and Vittorio, bowing
their heads to one another, carry on a conversation in
a slight whisper.</p>

<p>All the crowd in the church is inattentive and distracted.
Scarcely anyone follows the movements and
acts of the priest at the altar. Many men and women
raise themselves a little in their seats to watch the
erect, proud, silent heads of the two Archduchesses.
Others, the men especially, keep pointing at Mabel
Clarke, who, smiling, distrait, and detached, turns her
large grey eyes to those of Vittorio Lante, while he, with
eyes fixed on her, distracted, seized, conquered, tells her
things very softly, without ceasing to look and smile
at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>From the sides of the church men and women stretch
towards the organ, which is at the back, to find out if
Lidia Smolenska, the great singer, is there. A pale and
serious face is to be seen up above, a very light coiffure
beneath a feathered hat, which at once disappears,
hidden by the balustrade of the organ. Mechanically
people rise to their feet when the priest opens the Gospel.
Some cross themselves through old custom, others in
imitation; very few make the three signs of the cross,
on the forehead, lips, and heart, as the rite directs;
vice versa, as they are standing people end by turning
to look around them, and almost to form groups.</p>

<p>But the priest has left the altar, and after a minute
he reappears in the pulpit to explain the day's Gospel.
All sit down more comfortably: they turn towards the
pulpit and gradually become silent. In a gently pronounced
French, with a soft accent, stretching out in
pleasant circumlocutions, the parable of the day's Gospel
is expounded, that of the master who asks an account
from his servants of the way in which they have employed
their time. With florid gestures the priest
questions the crowd and does not wait for a reply; he
admonishes them, but tenderly, on the use of time, of
that which has been done well and ill in ten years, in a
year, in a day, in an hour. And he does it all in his
insinuating and caressing French, so as not to oppress
or frighten those who are listening to him, who have come
from every part of the world, all of whom are very rich,
or at least seem rich, all of whom are of high birth and
origin, or at least bear great names, all these ladies who,
as he sees and knows, cling to life&mdash;to a true or false
youth, simple or artificial. Suddenly the priest heals
with the balm of hope, in soft and rolling French, a
certain light spiritual agitation that had risen in the
souls of the crowd, at the doubt that they had badly
used their time in enjoyment, vice, corruption, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cruelty. But what does it matter, for here is a priest
to promise them divine mercy in a French full of pardon
and indulgence? So the congregation, which perhaps
has not been agitated at all, and has never considered
that it has sacrificed to the senses, to vice, and perdition,
hears the tenderest absolution falling on its shoulders in
the name of divine clemency; and it finds this unasked-for
pardon and clemency suddenly coming in plenitude
in the name of God. But the priest has not finished.
In even more mellifluous French, full of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hÃ©las</i> and sighs,
he begs alms for the poor, very poor, church of St.
Moritz Bad, which for years has been crushed by its
building debt. The church has cost too much because
of its campanile, which is a monument, and through
want of money its interior is undecorated and mean;
so the priest turns humbly, sighing and lamenting,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã  ses trÃ¨s chers frÃ¨res, Ã  ses chÃ¨res s&#339;urs</i>, that the collection
may give a substantial sum to the poor church of
St. Moritz Bad. Then he disappears from the pulpit.</p>

<p>The great moment has arrived: everybody in church
rises, turns, and cranes to watch. The couple who are
to collect are about to begin their duties.</p>

<p>The Archduchess Maria Vittoria was the first to rise,
followed by a beardless youth of eighteen, the Comte de
Roy, a Frenchman, the son of an Austrian Princess,
hence connected, if remotely, with the House of Austria.
Maria Vittoria kneels a moment before the High Altar,
then she takes from the hands of the Comte de Roy a
silver plate. She advances to her aunt, the Archduchess
Maria Annunziata, and makes her a profound curtsey,
a Court curtsey, and stoops to kiss the long, skinny,
white hand which places in the plate a large gold coin,
a hundred lire piece. Followed by the Comte de Roy,
the fifteen-year-old girl, tall and slim, rather too tall
and thin perhaps, like her great-aunt, enters among the
congregation to the right of the High Altar. Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Vittoria does not smile, her proud mouth with the thick
lower lip is closed tightly, her very thick opaque eyes
scarcely fix themselves for a moment upon the person
from whom she is asking alms. Coins of silver and gold
fall with a tinkle into the plate; she scarcely bows her
head in thanks, and passes on, without looking at or
turning to her cavalier who follows her. Curiosity about
her is very soon exhausted; the congregation examines
her first with respect, then with indifference, and in
some she awakes antipathy by her stiffness and sovereign
pride. Quietly she crosses the church imprisoned in her
thoughts and feelings. Her plate is covered with gold
and silver coins, covered but not overflowing. She pays
no heed to what is given her; in fact, she moves and
mingles with the congregation, without scarcely anyone
bothering further about her.</p>

<p>Mabel Clarke also salutes the altar, but with a short,
slight bow; Don Vittorio Lante follows her and offers
her another silver plate. The American girl approaches
the Archduchess Maria Annunziata, and instead of the
deep Court curtsey she makes her an elegant bow, the
bow of the <em>Lancers</em>, throwing her a lively glance and
gracious smile. The Archduchess moulds a pallid smile
on her lips, and places another big gold coin in the plate,
the same alms that she had given to her niece&mdash;one
hundred francs in gold.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, Altesse</i>," exclaims Mabel Clarke, with a
strong American accent.</p>

<p>She stops a moment, opens her white leather purse,
spreads upon the plate, close to the gold coin of her
Imperial and Royal Highness, the cheque for four hundred
dollars&mdash;two thousand francs&mdash;which her mother,
Annie Clarke, gave her. The Archduchess glances for
a moment, a rush of blood flushes the pale, ivory-like
face, then with an act of Christian humility she bows her
head and prays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel Clarke's action has been seen by the first row
of people near the altar, the action and the slip of white
paper thrown into the plate has been seen and commented
on. Like a long shiver it is communicated from
row to row right to the back of the church. All murmur
and whisper that there is a Clarke cheque in the plate,
"Three hundred, five hundred lire, no, a thousand;
scarcely a hundred and fifty, five hundred." And the
crowd sways backwards and forwards, forgetful that
already at the altar the first bell is ringing for the beginning
of the sacrifice of the Host. Mabel Clarke in
her white dress penetrates the congregation to the right
of the High Altar, holding her plate a little raised to
show it better. Her large grey eyes sparkle beneath
the subtle arch of their chestnut eyebrows; the beautiful
florid mouth over the white teeth smiles. She looks the
person well in the face of whom she begs, as she smilingly
repeats in French, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour notre chÃ¨re Ã©glise, Madame ...
pour notre chÃ¨re Ã©glise, Monsieur....</i>" Neither woman
nor man resists the curiosity of detaining near them for
a moment the daughter of the man six hundred times
a millionaire, Mabel Clarke, the bride to be with twenty,
thirty, fifty millions; and immediately after the
curiosity an irresistible sympathy rises for the beautiful
creature, beautiful with a new beauty, a new florescence,
a new blood, of a new grace caused by new features, and
of a charm caused by a new fascination.</p>

<p>All, men and women, from curiosity, sympathy, or
vanity, as they see the Clarke cheque on which the coins
are piling, give more than they wish to give; and she,
smiling and bowing the white forehead, where the
rebellious wave of hair is falling, thanks them with her
marked American accent: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, merci, Madame, mille
fois ... merci, Monsieur, bien merci.</i>" She smiles and
passes by, Don Vittorio Lante follows almost close beside
her. He is a little pale and disturbed; perhaps all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
contacts annoy him; but he does not say so. Then the
altar bell invites the faithful to kneel; a few who are
attentive kneel. Mabel Clarke has gradually reached
her American friends and they surround her with little
subdued cries of joy and affection, while she smilingly
offers the plate among them. The Wests, Milners,
Rodds open their purses and smilingly draw out long
white cheques and throw them in the plate, exclaiming,
"Dear Mabel," "Darling," "Mabel dear."</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, contented, and happy she piles up the
cheques in the middle, under the gold pieces. She smiles
and smiles, showing her white teeth.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dearest Ellen; thank you, dear, dear
Norah."</p>

<p>The two couples have now reached the back of the
church and meet, her Imperial and Royal Highness, the
Archduchess Maria Vittoria, and the Comte de Roy,
Mabel Clarke and Don Vittorio Lante della Scala. They
form a motionless group, for now at the altar the acolyte's
bell rings shrilly for the Elevation, and the congregation
is on its knees with bowed heads. But a pure voice is
raised up above at the organ. Lidia Smolenska sings
an <em>Ave Maria</em> in her deep, touching voice, accompanied
by the organ, which a German is playing, a tall German
with a pointed, iron-grey beard and the most beautiful
blue eyes&mdash;Otto von Rabbe, the friend of the mountains.
The deep notes of the organ accompany the voice of the
Polish lady that penetrates right to the heart, a voice
full of ardour, languor, and melancholy. Some heads
are gradually raised to hear better, faces are turned, and
other heads draw together to speak a word or two in a
very low whisper.</p>

<p>"... exiled?"</p>

<p>"... nihilist?"</p>

<p>"... schismatic?"</p>

<p>"... on the stage?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Elevation bell rings, and almost grudgingly heads
are lowered again, as they listen to the perfect voice
filling the church with its indescribable harmony, and
to the organ touched with a master's touch till it reaches
the most intimate fibres of the soul. Again there is a
light whispering:</p>

<p>"... Von Raabe?"</p>

<p>"... the great banker?"</p>

<p>"... musician, nephew of the great master, Raabe?"</p>

<p>"... a Lutheran?"</p>

<p>"... a Lutheran playing in a Catholic church?"</p>

<p>There is a loud ringing: the great mystery of Tran-substantiation
has been softly accomplished once more,
though the congregation perceives nothing but the relief
of rising and sitting down again, of being able to turn
towards the organ, as they get up to sit down, and look
at the white face of the Smolenska, where in its pallor
is expressed a mortal melancholy, and who knows what
secret voluptuousness. The two couples who have
halted at the back of the church, with bowed heads,
while our Lord descended in the consecrated Host, bow
to each other as they return to their places.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne quÃªte, Altesse!</i>" exclaimed Mabel Clarke,
with a familiar smile.</p>

<p>The Archduchess Maria Vittoria does not thank her
or exchange the good wishes. Bending her head with a
slight bow she withdraws, followed by the Comte de
Roy, and disappears on her side in the lateral nave.
Mabel Clarke with her plate full of money, which she
holds on high for fear of losing any of it, turns to Don
Vittorio Lante, encouraging him to continue the walk,
and both are lost on the other side. The priest at the
altar communicates with the species; but no one heeds
him. For now AndrÃ© de Beauregard is singing a motet
from Handel. His pure, crystalline voice resembles a
clear spring of mountain water that rises singing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
trilling amidst the rocks of a very lofty ridge, and proceeds
therefrom, ever singing and trilling, amidst
meadows and grass and flowers. Just as the Smolenska's
voice is ardent, so is AndrÃ©'s limpid and silvery, and
Otto von Raabe with his large, brown, knotty hands
sounds the organ lightly, as if for a gay, childish game.
In vain the second Gospel invites the faithful to rise
again; in vain the last formalities of the Divine Sacrifice
unfold themselves. From head to head the murmuring
begins afresh.</p>

<p>"... He could have millions."</p>

<p>"... If he liked to."</p>

<p>"... he doesn't like."</p>

<p>"... At New York."</p>

<p>"... <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dommage, dommage</i>."</p>

<p>"... <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dommage</i>."</p>

<p>The song dwindles and dies away. The Mass is not
yet finished; but all rise to leave, almost precipitately,
while the priest is still kneeling at the foot of the altar
for the last ejaculatory prayers. The church is at once
deserted. Beneath the portico in the bright noontide
the Archduchess stopped for a moment, her niece
silently beside her. Both collectors have deposited their
money in the sacristy. Already it is known that Mabel
Clarke has gathered eight thousand francs, made up for
the most part of American cheques. Mabel Clarke is
among the respectful circle of ladies that has been formed
before the Archduchess. The Princess turns to her with
a brief smile, as if summoning her to her. The American
girl advances, blushing with complacency.</p>

<p>"You have done much for the church, Miss Clarke,"
said the Archduchess slowly.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment, with perfect Christian humility,
she added:</p>

<p>"Please thank Mrs. Clarke, too, for her generosity."</p>

<p>There is a large princely leave-taking round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Archduchess Maria Annunziata. The ladies make deep
curtseys, and for a moment the little square resembles
a royal <em>salon</em>. Before even the two Archduchesses have
got into their carriage, Mabel Clarke has taken leave of
her American friends, and she sets off with Don Vittorio
Lante by the longest way that climbs from the Dorf to
the "Palace." At a certain point Mabel Clarke opens
her white cambric parasol, and the two young heads
disappear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>The clouds kept climbing continually behind the hill
of the Maloja, suspended by an impetuous wind,
which sometimes grew quiet for a while and then
rose again violently and rudely in immense gusts. The
clouds appeared in great masses white as snow and silver,
with a light, delicate grey, a grey mixed with lily, and
a leadlike grey, in every gradation from white to grey.
They appeared in deep, vast masses, suspended by the
wind and spread over the Engadine; they covered the
whole sky and almost seemed to touch the summits of
the less lofty mountains. They were reflected in all
their gigantesque forms and changing colours on the
lakes of Sils, of Silvaplana, Campfer, and St. Moritz.
They took away the blue from the sky and the brightness
of the sun from the little towns, villages, and districts,
giving them a pale grey tint. They passed,
running and almost galloping, over the large hill that
encloses St. Moritz at the foot of its lake, and passed
over the valley of Samaden down towards Bevers, where
the Engadine begins to descend.</p>

<p>Experienced eyes, which were raised to the sky in the
morning, curiously and anxiously, perhaps hoped for,
and believed in, one of those sudden and surprising
passages of storm clouds which rise from the Val Bregaglia,
the Italian clouds which traverse for an hour or two
the immense plain of the upper Engadine, then descend
behind the Valley of Samaden, towards the lower
Engadine, and disappear, leaving the sky pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
clear, as if their passage had cleansed it. Experienced
eyes had hoped and believed this, relying chiefly on the
great wind that pursued the clouds, that caused the
surfaces of the lakes to be covered with a thousand
ripples, that almost formed these little waves with white
crests like a sea; relying on this wind that caused the
dust to whirl on the road from the Maloja to Samaden
and all the trees with their lofty green plumes to rustle
lamentingly; trusting that this terrible wind, which
filled with its crashing the whole Engadine, would at
last chase away the Italian clouds, and precipitate them
into the lower Engadine.</p>

<p>But for hours and hours the clouds continued to
ascend from Bregaglia. For hours they substituted
themselves for those which already had vanished afar,
precipitated towards Scanfs and Tarasp; for hours
they came and joined themselves to the clouds not
already dispersed, and added and heaped themselves
upon them, more thickly, closely, and gigantically.
Experienced eyes then understood that not even the
imperious and boisterous wind which was rising incessantly
from the Val Bregaglia and spreading them
victoriously over all the Engadine, that was pressing
and pursuing them with fury behind the horizon of the
Val di Samaden; they understood sorrowfully that not
even that wind would conquer and overcome the clouds,
to free the blue sky and bright sun. Moreover, suddenly
the exhausted and vanquished wind fell. The conquering
clouds ceased to gallop, and spread themselves, at
first quietly and then without movement, like an
immense deep pavement, now white, now pearl-grey,
now leaden-grey, over all the Upper Engadine. Everything
became the colour of the clouds: the air, the
waters of the lakes, the colouring of the little rustic
houses, lordly villas, towns and districts; the larches
became darker and more gloomy in their brown verdure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two in the afternoon. But beneath the deep
veil of clouds, beneath that great canopy which hid the
lofty summits, which fringed the lower peaks and almost
razed the more modest hills, in that atmosphere tinted
with a monotonous colour, now white, now grey, but
always pale and lifeless, time seemed not to exist, and
it seemed as if it were a long, equal day, half dead,
without dawn, afternoon, or evening. The furious wind
that irritates and excites, exalts and exasperates, had
vanished, and instead the calm sadness, broad and
motionless, of an afternoon without end had spread
itself everywhere.</p>

<p>Even sadder in its imposing lines was the great Valley
of Samaden, shut out and divided from that of St.
Moritz by the hill of CharnadÃ¼ras, peculiarly cut in two,
covered to the right by a pretty little wood of shady
trees, aromatic plants, and Alpine flowers, so austere
and dominated here by the Corvatsch and Rosatch,
which are girded and hemmed in by the Muottas Muraigl,
while in the middle, where it is broadest, the valley
opens, showing in the background, over the Roseg
glacier, the very lofty, white, virginal beauty of the
tremendous Bernina. This great valley lacks the grace
and fascination of the delightful lakes of Sils, Silvaplana,
and St. Moritz, while through its immense green meadows
flow, foaming white like milk, the Flatzbach, which
comes from the Bernina singing its subdued song, and
the little brook Schlattenbeich. But these foaming,
fleeting waters do not succeed in enlivening and vivifying
the countryside&mdash;the great valley where little Cresta
and tiny Celerina seem lost, and even Samaden seems
lost in the remote corner of the plain; the great valley
that seems inanimate, although the railway crosses it,
and equipages, carriages, and pedestrians of all kinds
traverse it, going and coming from St. Moritz and
Pontresina. The isolated villas gleam white against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the green of the meadows; the hotels of Cresta and
Celerina show their verandahs shaded by awnings and
straw or canvas protections for those who like the open
air but fear wind and sun. The Cresta Palace raises
its four storeys with its hundred rooms, carved balconies,
and Swiss banner. Carriages come and go rapidly and
slowly from every part, but the Valley of Samaden preserves
its solitary austerity, and this close veil of clouds
which extends from St. Moritz to the extreme horizon
seems as if made to cover it completely, and it seems as
if that colourless, pale air belonged to the Valley of
Samaden, and that this dead afternoon was its afternoon,
which better suited its vastness, solitude, and immense
melancholy.</p>

<p>The villa of Karl Ehbehard rises isolated in a broad
meadow, that gradually slopes from a faÃ§ade with two
storeys to the opposite faÃ§ade with three. It is situated
between Cresta and Celerina; the principal faÃ§ade, that
with two storeys, is almost on the side of the high road
which goes from Cresta to Celerina. Round the villa,
which is very new in the bright colouring of its stones,
in the light wood and carving of its verandahs, runs a
strip of land which forms a little garden enclosed by a
wooden fence, and in front, at the edge of the road, by
a trellis. This tiny garden which surrounds and embraces
the Villa Ehbehard is planted with shrubs and
bright Swiss flowers, red, yellow, purple, and white;
but still all these little plants and flowers have not had
much time in which to grow. The wooden windows
and the central verandah, with their carved balustrades
and little roofs, are also adorned with vases of flowers,
mountain carnations, Alpine geraniums, and winter
roses. On the grey, almost white stones and bright
wood these flowers, miraculously cultivated at such an
altitude, smile brightly. At the rear faÃ§ade of Villa
Ehbehard, which is the taller, looking towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
meadows that billow peculiarly in little mounds and
ditches, on the first floor there is a large covered, yet
open terrace, supported by pillars&mdash;an Italian terrace.
In the centre is a large table covered with books and
newspapers; there are a few chairs and arm-chairs, and
on the stone parapet are placed vases with plants. And
if from the windows and verandah of the chief faÃ§ade of
Villa Ehbehard there is a continuous spectacle of people
passing in carriages, on bicycles and on foot, and the
train is to be seen passing from Albula to disappear in
the tunnel beneath the hill of CharnadÃ¼ras, and opposite
there is the Cresta Palace with all its movement of a
caravanserai, and further on the little HÃ´tel Frizzoni
with its confectionery shop and tea garden, full of tables
at which to take tea at five, and full of people, from the
terrace in the rear of Villa Ehbehard the whole scene
changes completely. Here in front a broad landscape
spreads in every direction. To the right, below, is the
gloomy gorge of the Inn, whence it issues like a ribbon
of shining metal amidst the tumultuous billows of the
meadows, and near the river is the brown, almost black
wood that jealously hides the sad, little, deserted lake
of Statz; then there is the great canopy of larches that
follows, from the estuary of the Meierei, the road that
leads to Pontresina. To the left in the lifeless air is the
little church and campanile of San Gian di Celerina,
where nowadays only the office for the dead is said, and
for the departed who have been buried and have slept
for so many years in the little cemetery; the broad
green stretch towards Samaden, and on high the white
peaks of Languard and Albris, and very far-off the Roseg
glacier, and the lady of the mountains, of snow and ice&mdash;the
white and fearsome Bernina. It is a landscape of
silence and peace, a landscape of thought and dream.</p>

<p>On that day, as usual at that hour, Doctor Karl
Ehbehard was seated alone in an arm-chair, reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and yet not reading, as he contemplated the landscape
thoughtfully. Of tall stature, thin and muscular, Karl
Fritz Ehbehard presented an aspect of strength, and his
face one of energy. On the large white forehead, his
black hair, which was quite streaked with white at the
temples, formed a thick, untidy tuft, mixed with white
hairs, a rebellious tuft that was displaced by every
movement of the head. Above the mouth a large thick
moustache sprinkled with white hid the expression of
the lips and the smile. The profile was fine and strong,
the complexion a rather pale tan. But the piercing,
very piercing, grey eyes were peculiar and impregnated
with a sadness that could also be pride and harshness;
peculiar eyes that pierced the face of whomsoever was
present, and spoke with such a flow of penetration that
the timid were frightened and the proud offended. His
neck in the high white collar was rather thin, and so
were his hands. He is in the prime of life, since he has
not yet reached fifty, every act and gesture of his and
every change of expression always indicating a complete
fusion of physical force and moral energy. His eyes
hurt with their cutting glance; but still in their depths
escape the sadness which humanly tempers everything
and humanly assuages.</p>

<p>A servant entered with a visiting-card on a tray. With
a fastidious air Karl Ehbehard interrupted his reading
and threw a glance at the name on the card. After a
moment of hesitation he said to the man in German:</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>Ehbehard put down his books and got up, advancing
towards the door of the terrace which gave on to the
apartment. A lady appeared and stopped at the threshold
as if doubtful of coming out. Just bowing slightly
Doctor Karl Ehbehard said to her, pointing to a chair:</p>

<p>"It is better here, Your Highness."</p>

<p>Enveloped in a large coat of marten fur, over which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she had placed a fur tippet, with a veil of the finest white
lace, the Grand Duchess of Gotha advanced to the chair,
into which she let herself fall, as if tired by the stairs she
had been forced to climb, and after taking breath for a
while, she raised her white veil and carried her fur muff
to her mouth, so as not to breathe suddenly and directly
the fresh air. And Karl Ehbehard saw again the woman's
face with its Teutonic ugliness, spreading features, forehead
too high, mouth too broad, eyes with lashes too
bright, eyebrows too light, temples hollowed, and in
addition the traces of disease&mdash;a complexion rendered
yellow everywhere, and pinkish on the cheek-bones, the
ears very white, the lips bloodless, and the neck very
thin. There was an expression of fear, oppression, and
loss in the almost white eyes. The yellowish hair was
precociously whitened, and drawn back without grace
and tightened into a bunch. All that was feminine was a
great richness of apparel, of lace, and furs over a long,
thin, bony body. The Grand Duchess, as she breathed,
opened her lips with a certain effort, showing her large,
yellowish teeth. But in spite of all this she preserved a
sovereign air.</p>

<p>"Still the same, Herr Doctor," she said, in a rather
rough voice.</p>

<p>"Your Highness has slept?" asked the great doctor,
indifferently.</p>

<p>"Slept, yes; five or six hours."</p>

<p>"That is sufficient. Did you cough on waking?"</p>

<p>"As every day."</p>

<p>"Not more?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Fever?"</p>

<p>"A degree or two yesterday evening; four or five
degrees."</p>

<p>"Perspiration?"</p>

<p>"A little&mdash;as usual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, Your Highness, there is nothing fresh."</p>

<p>"Nothing fresh indeed!" she exclaimed, raising her
voice, like a little cry, and coughing immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Very coldly and quietly, the great phthisis doctor
waited for the Grand Duchess to begin all the daily
grievances, which she came every day to explain to him,
at least to get consolation.</p>

<p>"I get no better, Herr Doctor."</p>

<p>"But Your Highness gets no worse."</p>

<p>"How long can all this last?"</p>

<p>"A long time, a long time yet."</p>

<p>She looked at him, with her light eyes more troubled
than ever: she looked at him, half consoled and uncertain.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that this can last, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," he said, still coldly but firmly.</p>

<p>"Shall I not die within a month or a year, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>?
Tell me."</p>

<p>Coldly, icily, he looked at her with his terribly penetrating
eyes, which, however, were sad and even pitiful.
Without hesitation he answered her.</p>

<p>"Neither within a month nor a year."</p>

<p>She bowed her head and sighed deeply: and an expression
of comfort spread itself on the face worn with
disease, which had neither beauty nor grace, but yet
inspired interest and pity.</p>

<p>"May I not leave for Gotha?" she murmured
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"The Grand Duke complains of my long absence."</p>

<p>"Does that matter?"</p>

<p>"My children are alone; why may I not see them?"</p>

<p>"Your presence, Your Highness, would do them more
harm than good."</p>

<p>"I am bored here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you live, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"Yes, I live, it is true; but I don't care either for the
country or the people," she said, with an accent of disgust.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because I am ill; because I can no longer do what
the others do. I only like you here, Herr Doctor."</p>

<p>And she looked at him as at a sacred image, with reverence
and almost with fear.</p>

<p>"But why?" he asked, without showing surprise.</p>

<p>"Because you, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, know the secret of my life
and death. Won't you come to Gotha?"</p>

<p>"No, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"Not even for me?"</p>

<p>"Not even for you, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"Are you so fond of this country? Why do you
like it so much?" she asked weakly, still a little discouraged.</p>

<p>"Because it has a secret of life and not of death, Your
Highness," added Doctor Karl Ehbehard mysteriously,
with a slight bow.</p>

<p>She understood and rose. She came towards him, took
his two hands in hers, and pressing them said:</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that I ought to remain in this
country?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, Your Highness."</p>

<p>"When shall I be able to go away?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Certainly not now. Perhaps after a
long time."</p>

<p>She bowed her head and added nothing further.</p>

<p>"Thanks, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, good-bye till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Till to-morrow, Your Highness."</p>

<p>Without undue hurry, correctly but silently, he led her
within the apartment and let the servant accompany her
below to the carriage, to which were attached two
spirited, dapple-grey horses. The Grand Duchess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Gotha wrapped her marten mantle better around her,
pressed to her neck the fur tippet, closed her mouth
firmly behind the close veil, drew over her knees the soft
carriage-rug, and alone and silently, looking at no one,
wrapped in herself, but preserving a regal air, she
vanished to the rapid trotting of her horses towards
St. Moritz and Campfer, where she dwelt in the solitary
Villa Sorretta.</p>

<p>Afterwards the servant ushered in to the doctor on the
terrace two other patients, the brothers Freytag, the
great bankers of Vienna, who only came once or twice
a week, the sons and nephews of the great Freytags,
bankers of Frankfort, Hamburg, and London, bankers
and shippers as well.</p>

<p>Since the winter, which they had passed at the HÃ´tel
Kulm at the Dorf, save for a break of two months, April
and May, when the one had returned to Vienna and the
other to Frankfort, they had repaired to Doctor Karl
Ehbehard twice a week. Of the two Freytag brothers
one only seemed to be ill, because in spite of his thirty-five
years his tall figure was bent, his slender shoulders
beneath his navy-blue coat formed a curve, his breast
beneath the white woollen waistcoat with the gold
buttons seemed as narrow as that of a bird. Already his
black hair was scanty and always seemed to be moist;
beneath the eyebrows the eyes were hollow. But underlying
all this was a fineness of feature, a sweetness of
expression, and a lordliness of manner that made Max
Freytag even more interesting. The other brother,
younger by four or five years, seemed most healthy. Of
middle stature, fat, with a rather thick throat and neck,
very fair with heavy moustaches and bright hair, Ludwig
Freytag had a good-natured, healthy, middle-class
appearance.</p>

<p>Max first began to relate in German all that had happened
to him during the three days that he had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to Villa Ehbehard. He spoke slowly with a rather suave
voice, saying that every degree of fever had vanished,
that the cough was less, but that he was not sleeping and
eating, that he was not digesting and could not contrive
to conquer the insomnia. The doctor listened, with his
hands on the arms of his chair, motionless and indifferent.</p>

<p>"Is Frau Freytag still with you?" he suddenly asked.</p>

<p>"She is still with me."</p>

<p>"It is a grave imprudence and great sacrifice."</p>

<p>"I know it is," murmured Max Freytag; "but I
can't prevent her. I have tried, and I cannot."</p>

<p>"She loves you, and you love her?" asked the doctor
harshly.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured the other, in an even lower voice.</p>

<p>"Why did you marry her when you were ill?"</p>

<p>"I did not wish to marry her because I knew I was
ill. She wished to marry me because I was ill."</p>

<p>"Frau Freytag is an angel," said the doctor icily.</p>

<p>"An angel," agreed the other, and became silent.</p>

<p>After a moment's silence Max Freytag resumed:</p>

<p>"Do you believe, doctor, that her presence and propinquity
does me harm physically?"</p>

<p>And all the egoism of an invalid, of a consumptive,
was in the anxiety of this question.</p>

<p>"No," replied the doctor precisely, "it does you no
harm."</p>

<p>"Without her I could not live," groaned the consumptive.</p>

<p>"But she could die," declared Karl Ehbehard, fixing
Max Freytag with his sharp eyes, and piercing his soul.</p>

<p>"Charlotte is so young, so strong, so beautiful," stammered
Max Freytag.</p>

<p>The doctor said nothing more. Then Ludwig Freytag
opened his thick, florid lips and slowly told the doctor the
progress of his malady. It was graver than that of his
brother, and while nothing revealed it externally, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
nothing but the expert eye of Karl Ehbehard could have
discovered its creeping, it was making a constant, destructive,
almost invincible progress. While he spoke of
the long fits of coughing that suffocated him, morning,
evening, and night, of his agitated slumbers, of his profuse
nocturnal sweating, of the fever that assailed him at
every dawn; fat, gross, rosy, with a bull neck, and his
round, limpidly-blue eyes, almost obese on his short legs,
Ludwig Freytag seemed the picture of health. Seized by
the fixed idea of the disease that was consuming them,
Max Freytag, who seemed the more ill, and Ludwig
Freytag, actually the more ill although he did not recognise
it, began to lament, now the one, then the other, of
the horrible existence they were living&mdash;Max for ten
years, Ludwig for five, the one thirty-five, the other
thirty&mdash;an existence consisting only of medical cures, of
a rigorous rÃ©gime, of obligatory sojournings and obligatory
journeys. Ah, how above everything the two
brothers complained of having to live far-away from
Vienna, from Frankfort, from Hamburg, from London;
far from their banking-houses, from the colossal port
whence their ships departed, far from their powerful
businesses and their vast interests, and so losing their
great chances of gaining millions with their stagnating
fortune.</p>

<p>"To be rich does not matter, it is to live that matters,"
interrupted Doctor Ehbehard, with a cutting glance.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was too true," groaned the two brothers,
Max with his soft, sweet voice and perfect distinction,
Ludwig fretting, fuming, always seeming to suffocate.
After all living mattered, but <em>that</em> life apart from every
festivity, from every distraction, like two paupers
separated from the world and its pleasures, condemned
to measure even what they ate, to analyse what they
drank, destined to live in the great centres of joy and
luxury, like two wandering shadows, avoiding rooms too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
warm, verandahs too cold, and smoking-rooms&mdash;what a
life of renunciation!</p>

<p>"One must make renunciations to live," declared
Doctor Karl, slightly pale, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, renunciations," they said, Max Freytag in an
almost weeping voice, and Ludwig with one of grotesque
anger; but what a destiny for both to be struck down by
this cruel disease, which no one in their family had ever
had&mdash;both sons of the head of the House of Freytag, the
only sons of the House of Freytag&mdash;as if stricken to death
by a curse, although they could live perhaps and drag out
their life, yet they must implacably die of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly both became silent, in consternation, Max
pale and as if convulsed, Ludwig heated and asthmatical.
They became silent, gazing with eyes full of tears at
Doctor Ehbehard, with an expression of great sorrow and
supplication. He from his seat looked at the two ailing
brothers, vowed to infirmity and death; he looked at
them and his eyes lost all indifference and harshness.
Perhaps beneath his thick, sprinkled moustache his lips
trembled; for he was slow to answer them. Before and
around the two men the great Alpine landscape, even
more lifeless, beneath the weight of its motionless clouds,
spread itself. And not a noise nor a breath of wind came
to give them the living sense of life.</p>

<p>Slowly, meaning every word, with a sagacity which
did not only come from science, Doctor Ehbehard began
to discuss, one by one, all the complaints of the brothers,
and if there was no promise in his just words, if there
was no false hope in his phrases, at any rate they inspired
patience, and calm hope; they restored equilibrium,
tranquillity, and peace to those agitated spirits.
Like two children, fixing and holding his eyes with their
imploring eyes, noting every word and impressing them
on their memory, making no gesture so as to lose nothing
of what he was saying, so as not to lose a fleeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
expression, like children who wished for succour, protection,
and strength, Max and Ludwig Freytag regained
courage and moral vigour in the presence of Karl Ehbehard.
He did not speak entirely to Max, who was the less
ill of the two and who might be cured, but he told them
both that their life was still tenacious, and that their
youth could not be conquered either easily or soon. He
did not promise them perfect health, but he promised
them the superior energy that supports disease and ends
by obeying it. Karl Ehbehard did not pity their cruel
destiny, which in them was destroying their fortune and
their house, but he invited them to pity so many other
invalids, thousands and hundreds of thousands who were
languishing and perishing for want of care and medicine,
sick and languishing of gloomy misery, who had no more
means of supporting their families, and dying, would
leave them in extreme poverty. And all the human
sorrow of disease that finds no obstacles or contrasts, of
the disease that ruins, that tortures, that whips, that
slays, since its companion is misery, all the human sorrow
of hundreds of thousands of sufferers who were perishing
without succour, medicine and food, in narrow death-dealing
houses, on hard beds of cold and want&mdash;all this
inconsolable, disconsolate human suffering was reviewed
in the calm, firm words of Karl Ehbehard, shone from his
glance, and flowed from his voice. The two brothers felt
calmed and soothed, as if their little insignificant sorrow
were dissolved in their mind.</p>

<p>When they had left, Doctor Ehbehard remained for
some time quite alone on his terrace, where he was wont
to pass the afternoon, and where, to the surprise of all his
new clients, he preferred to receive the visits of the sick
instead of in his large consulting-room, furnished like
the other rooms, and which looked out on the principal
faÃ§ade at the back. Again his reading absorbed him, but
it was more a concentration of spirit, a recollection of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thoughts, since he seldom turned over the pages. Twice
while he was thus taken and conquered by his interior
life, his faithful servant appeared at the doorway to tell
his master something, but knowing him quite well and
seeing him thus immersed in silence, and motionless, he
had not dared to call him. At last, at the third time, he
ventured to disturb a chair to attract Doctor Karl's
attention, who, raising his head, as if aroused from a
lethargy, looked at him as in a dream. He read the
visiting-card that the servant offered him twice.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vicomtesse de Bagdad</i>," he read in French, and
then added to the servant in German:</p>

<p>"New?"</p>

<p>"New."</p>

<p>She whom Doctor Karl Fritz Ehbehard covered with a
most rapid scrutinising glance, hardly had she appeared
on the terrace hesitating to advance, was a woman of
forty-five, very dark and pale, with a thick mass of
black hair without a thread of white, with a face of perfect
features without a wrinkle, of a complete beauty,
already mature, and which, perhaps, would still last for
years before declining. Cunningly this mature beauty
was supported by dominant, but not offensive, traces of
cosmetics and bistre&mdash;a light shade of pink on the cheeks
a little too pale, a slight trace of rouge on the well-designed
lips. There was an even more cunning taste in
the dressing of the hair, in her clothes and hat, an intense
but discreet luxury, an exquisite but yet prudent
elegance. But over all this beauty, which must have
been invincible twenty years ago, and dazzling ten years
ago, there was a proud and scornful expression. At some
moments this mature beauty became rather austere or
even gloomy, in the blackness of the eyes, in the soft and
knotted eyebrows, in the closed mouth, as if hermetically
sealed. At a nod from the doctor, who, without showing
interest, continued to scrutinise her, she sat down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame has come to consult a doctor?" he asked in
French, with a German accent, but as if he attached
no importance to the reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor. But do we have to discuss here?" she
observed, with a slight gesture of wonder and perhaps of
impatience.</p>

<p>"Here, Madame," he replied tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Can we not retire into a room? Will it not be better?"</p>

<p>"No," he declared, "it is better to remain in the open
air in the Engadine."</p>

<p>"For sick people?"</p>

<p>"For sick and healthy," he added, "nothing is of
greater value than air in this country."</p>

<p>And he threw a glance around at the landscape. The
lady bowed, perhaps not convinced but mollified.</p>

<p>"Are you ill, Madame?"</p>

<p>"No, Herr Doctor," she replied.</p>

<p>And a sudden pallor caused her dark face to become
livid.</p>

<p>"Someone who is most dear to me," she added with
lowered eyes, "my son&mdash;my only son&mdash;I fear consumption."</p>

<p>Again a rush of pallor passed over her features.</p>

<p>"Why did you not bring him with you, Madame?"</p>

<p>She raised her magnificent black eyes, where an
immense pride was apparent, and looked at the doctor.</p>

<p>"Through fear, through fear," she stammered.</p>

<p>"Fear, Madame?"</p>

<p>"For fear that you might have something serious to
tell my son. He is twenty-five, Doctor."</p>

<p>"I should have said nothing before him," said the
great consumption doctor slowly. "I should have told
you afterwards."</p>

<p>"Ah, he would have understood everything!" exclaimed
the woman sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Is he so ill, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very, very ill, Herr Doctor."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"For a year."</p>

<p>"And how old is he?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five, Herr Doctor; I was twenty when I
had him," she declared, without circumlocution.</p>

<p>"Have you ever suffered from what he is suffering,
Madame?" asked the doctor coldly.</p>

<p>"No; never, never," she replied at once.</p>

<p>"And the father?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"The father of my son was not my husband. I have
never been married."</p>

<p>She said this without timidity and without boldness,
with a calm certainty, as if Doctor Ehbehard ought to
know or guess at once who she was.</p>

<p>"And was he ill, Madame? Try to remember."</p>

<p>"Not ill, but very delicate."</p>

<p>"This illness, then, comes from the father," concluded
the doctor.</p>

<p>"But you will cure him, won't you, Herr Doctor?"
she exclaimed anxiously. "I am come first to tell you all.
Doctor, I have only this son. You must cure him. You
must tell me everything, and I will do everything you tell
me. I am very rich, Herr Doctor. My friends have been
very generous to me. I am the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vicomtesse de Bagdad</i>;
have you never heard my name? A false name, Herr
Doctor. I am not called so. My real name doesn't matter,
nor would my money matter if it were not of use to cure
my son Robert."</p>

<p>Now she seemed another woman. The disdain and
pride which rendered her beauty austere, and at times
gloomy, had disappeared. Anguish was transforming
the womanly face that had lived so many years solely
for pleasure, the senses, and voluptuousness. Each
feature revealed simple, bare, maternal suffering&mdash;the
suffering of every mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doctor, they are sending us away from the hotel
where we are! In fact, all the women tremble for their
husbands and sons on my account. They do not know
that I see them not, and know them not. I do not wish
to see or know their men. But in a way it is right. Think,
Doctor&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vicomtesse de Bagdad</i>!"</p>

<p>Two long tears of anger, shame, and sorrow descended
the pallid cheeks and fell on her bosom. She wiped her
face at once, feverishly.</p>

<p>"Do not disturb yourself," he said in a firm tone, in
that tone which was wont to raise the mind of whomsoever
listened to him. "If they send you away from the
hotel, go into a villa; you will find one."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will find one," she exclaimed, consoled at once.
"And you will come there, Doctor? You will come?
You are a virtuous and great man; if you come to the
villa you will have no scandal: you will only find Robert
and me, ourselves alone, the poor mamma with her poor
son. You will come, won't you?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you have found the villa I will come."</p>

<p>"And you will cure Robert, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"I do not know: I don't know at all."</p>

<p>"But you will try, won't you? You will try?"
seizing his hands, with a mother's cry.</p>

<p>"I promise to try my best," he replied.</p>

<p>A short sigh broke the voice of the woman who had
lived only for pleasure and vice, and who now was a
mother grieved to the heart. She choked in her cambric
handkerchief, fragrant with a delicate perfume. She
bowed her head a minute to compose herself before
leaving, and then left followed by the silken rustling of
her train.</p>

<p>When Karl Ehbehard was again alone on the terrace,
that projected into the solitary and imposing landscape
in the declining day, he did not resume his reading, nor
did he contemplate thoughtfully the austere lines of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
mountains and the great curtain of trees which hid the
road, and the waters running and leaping amidst the
thick grass of the meadows. As if tired, he let his head
fall on his breast, and all that he had seen and heard on
that day was weighing on his mind.</p>

<p>All the morning he had visited in his carriage sick
people who could not leave their houses, from those
isolated in far-off villas to those isolated in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©pendances</i>
of hotels, since in the summer-time, especially, no
hotel-keeper wished to have consumptives in his own
hotel, so as not to put to flight other travellers who came
to the Engadine, travellers who came there through love
of gaiety, of pleasure, of luxury, who came to the high
mountains through a refinement of the senses, wishing to
unite the spectacle of the beauty of things to an ardent,
febrile, worldly life.</p>

<p>All the morning, to the trotting of his horses, he had
gone to the Dorf, to the Bad, even to Campfer, awaited
everywhere with anxiety. He had touched fleshless hands
still feverish from the night; he had stooped to gather,
with acute ear, at the naked breast of the sick, the hoarse,
interior breathing; he had heard the dry attacks of
coughing following each other precipitously, leaving the
sick without breath; and he had listened to the long,
lamenting conversation of those who felt that they were
not growing better, who felt that they were growing
worse and declining to a fatal solution. Indeed, the whole
morning, with persuasive glance, with cold and calm
words, with whatever there was in him of moral force
and energy, he had striven to console all those who were
tormented by the fear of death; he had striven to comfort
them without lying to them, without promising them
anything, lest on the morrow they should be bitterly
deluded. He had striven to excite patience in them and
tranquil courage, telling them that when one wishes to
grow better and wishes it intensely, one does grow better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and that a secret of escaping death is to wish not to die
with all the mysterious vigour of will-power. And once
again, morning and afternoon, before the hundred sadnesses
more incurable than phthisis itself, before the
hundred woes of poor beings devoured by disease, he had
seen the singular, amazing miracle performed; he had
seen the sick grow calm and serene, resume vigour, and
smile, yes, smile, with vague, indefinite, infinite hope.
Through his presence and will-power for good, through
his firm serenity, he had seen the miracle renewed, however
brief and fleeting. The sick felt themselves better
without taking drugs, and felt themselves first tranquillised
and then excited to joy, yes, almost to joy! He
knew these miracles of these strange diseases; pious
miracles that make of the consumptive a being apart,
capable of smiling, of hoping, even to the last breath of
his destroyed lungs. He knew these miracles because
with his will-power for good and the fascination of his
eyes and words, he understood how to dominate, conquer,
and exalt the changeful, light minds of the poor sufferers
from phthisis. But the effort put forth by him on that
morning and afternoon, more than any other day, had
exhausted him. An immense weariness oppressed his
physiognomy and his limbs in the large arm-chair of
black leather, upon the arms of which his rather thin
hands were abandoning themselves, as if they, too, had
been struck by a profound weariness. When after a short
time he raised his head, Else von Landau was before him.</p>

<p>She had not been announced. Like the Grand Duchess
of Gotha, she came every day, when she felt bad, to the
Villa Ehbehard; sometimes, when she felt better, she
came there two or three times a week, like the brothers
Freytag. She knew where to find the doctor and how to
enter discreetly, so as not to disturb him if he were reading,
studying, or if he were thinking and resting. She had
entered cautiously without warning him of her presence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and had sat down at some distance from him, opening
her mantle of otter-skin with sweet, silvery revers of
chinchilla, beneath which she was dressed in brown cloth.
She had untied the large veil which surrounded face and
neck, and all the hat and head. Her delicate, white face,
with the clearest complexion, appeared even whiter
beneath the shining, soft chestnut hair. On the white
temples, beneath the grey eyes, a network of little blue
veins was delineated. With hands that clasped a large
bunch of Alpine flowers abandoned on her lap, now and
then biting her lips to make them redder, and coughing
very slightly so as not to be heard, she waited patiently
till Karl Ehbehard was aware of her. Seeing her the
doctor started; but he restrained a movement of impatient
weariness.</p>

<p>"How are you, then, FrÃ¤ulein Landau?" he asked
her monotonously in German, speaking as if in a dream.</p>

<p>"I am rather bad, Doctor," she replied, with a fleeting
smile on her lips.</p>

<p>Her voice was soft but hoarse; the veil, however,
increased its penetrating softness.</p>

<p>"Why? Tell me everything."</p>

<p>She settled herself better in her chair, crossed her
exquisitely booted little feet, which peeped out from the
skirt, put down her chinchilla muff, smelt her Alpine
flowers, and said:</p>

<p>"The pain up here has tormented me all the evening
and night. This morning, too, when coughing there were
some streaks of blood."</p>

<p>"Have you kept them, FrÃ¤ulein Landau?" he asked,
perfectly returned to himself, and again become the
doctor.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, with a shrug of the shoulders. "I
thought it was useless."</p>

<p>"It was not useless."</p>

<p>"Another time I will not fail," she murmured, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
slightly ironical tone; "I seem to have had fever again
for two or three days."</p>

<p>"Did you use the thermometer?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "I did not use it. I have thrown
away my thermometer; it tortured me too much. It is
an odious instrument. When I have fever I recognise it
from the palms of my hands."</p>

<p>"Still, it should have been necessary to know the
degree."</p>

<p>"What does it matter, Doctor?" she said, a little
more lively. "To sadden my mother? She has too
much sorrow, the poor dear!"</p>

<p>"But did you follow out my instructions?" the
doctor asked her patiently.</p>

<p>"I take all your medicines, Doctor, because my
mother makes me take them: I eat what you tell me
because she makes me eat it," she declared, again
smiling a little sarcastically.</p>

<p>"What about the rest?"</p>

<p>"The rest?"</p>

<p>"Do you go to bed early?"</p>

<p>"No, Doctor, I go to bed very late every night."</p>

<p>"And what do you do?"</p>

<p>"I dance nearly every evening, or chat with my
friends, or play bridge."</p>

<p>"Do you dance in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©colletÃ©</i> dress?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; every evening I am in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©colletÃ©</i> dress,
even if there is no dancing."</p>

<p>"And you have supper sometimes? Do you drink
champagne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor; I adore champagne."</p>

<p>"And what do you do in the morning and afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I go out on foot or in a carriage. We make excursions.
I walk a great deal when I can. I went on foot
to the Roseg glacier."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Always in company?"</p>

<p>"Always: I have various flirts, Doctor. One of them
especially is more than a flirt. He loves me. I am fond
of him and torment him with jealousy of my other
flirts."</p>

<p>The conversation developed, calmly and coldly on the
Doctor's side, brightly and mockingly, with a touch of
impertinent bitterness, on Else's side. He said to her:</p>

<p>"Why are you doing all this? To kill yourself?"</p>

<p>"To die the sooner," she declared suddenly, becoming
serious.</p>

<p>"Don't you care to live?"</p>

<p>"I don't care about living, sick, half alive, dying," she
declared, still very serious.</p>

<p>"You are making your poor mother despair."</p>

<p>"That is true; but it is better for her to get used to
despair for the time when she will lose me."</p>

<p>"She will die of grief."</p>

<p>"After me: I shall not see it, it will be all over,"
concluded Else von Landau gloomily. Then suddenly
she began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Dear Doctor, you have not told me, but I know that
I am doomed. Certainly I could drag on my life for
years by busying myself only with my drugs, my rÃ©gime,
the heat of my room; by watching myself from morn
till night, not speaking for fear of tiring my lungs, like
Maria Goertz, who has lived two years here with a
closed mouth; by fleeing from balls, festivities, theatres,
engagements, only wearing the thickest furs, unable to
go in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©colletÃ©</i> or transparent dresses, unable to have
either flirt or lover, forced to live summer and winter at
St. Moritz Dorf or Davos, or failing that in a sanatorium.
Oh, no, Doctor! I don't wish to live thus! That is no
life; I prefer to end it&mdash;to end it at once."</p>

<p>Her large, grey, velvety eyes, with almost blue pupils,
flashed with a desire of life and death, her complexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was flushed, and the little blue veins of the temples were
almost swollen. A funereal beauty was in her countenance.</p>

<p>"Doctor, Doctor," she resumed, in a higher but
rougher voice, "I don't want to exile myself, to cloister
myself; I don't want to renounce anything life should
give me or place within my reach. I don't want to
renounce being beautiful, being loved, smiling, and
becoming exhilarated with air, and sun, and love. I
wish to resign nothing and prefer to live less, live a very
short time, sooner than renounce things. I am thirty
and a widow. I have no sons and am rich. After my
death there is nothing but silence, Doctor. I don't want
to renounce things."</p>

<p>He looked at her, recognising in her the subtle delirium
of consumptives. He looked at her, so beautiful, so
charming and fragile, made to live, yet so desirous of
life and death, and at last his heart, after the long day
of fatigue and suffering for others, so closed and granite-like,
opened and welled with an immense pity for her
who was invoking death, who was ready to meet it, and
who was embracing it, because she would renounce
nothing.</p>

<p>Else von Landau resumed deliriously:</p>

<p>"Doctor, would you renounce them? Would you
renounce every good and joy and triumph, every excitement.
Would you renounce them?"</p>

<p>He looked at her, with a glance laden with mystery
and strength, and answered her in a clear voice:</p>

<p>"I did so: I made the renunciation."</p>

<p>Else was profoundly surprised and trembled all over,
questioning him with her beautiful, supplicating eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know how old I was when I was seized by
the chest affection you have?" he asked her, in a
cutting voice.</p>

<p>"You? You?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"At twenty-three I was seized and overthrown by
your malady," he continued. "I am from Basle, an old,
grey, cold place; but I went to study medicine in Germany,
at Heidelberg, and lived there four years in great
ardour for study and science, in a dream that absorbed
and devoured me. My masters conceived for me the
highest hopes. I myself was impetuous, but restrained
myself with waiting for some profound scientific mystery
that might be revealed to my desire and my tireless
discipline of work. One winter evening I was caught
on the road by a heavy shower. Next day I had inflammation
of the lungs. I spat blood for several days
and was dying. With difficulty I was rescued from
death, and six months afterwards, at twenty-three,
FrÃ¤ulein von Landau, I had tuberculosis of both lungs.
Those who were tending me tried to deceive me; but
I was a doctor and knew I must die. Someone told me
to come here for six months or a year. Full of fever,
still spitting blood, no longer sleeping or taking nourishment,
and despairing of everything, I came here. I am
forty-eight; for twenty-five years I have been here and
I have never left."</p>

<p>"Never at all? Never at all?" she cried, surprised,
moved to the depths of her soul.</p>

<p>"Never. Twenty-five years ago the Engadine was
an almost deserted region, wild and very sad in some
places; fearful and tragic in others. Some modest little
inn in the height of summer gave hospitality to a few
simple lovers of the mountains, to some invalid or convalescent.
There were no conveniences or pleasures or
luxury or elegance. Vast solitary horizons, immense
meadows whose flowers very few human feet disturbed;
mountains unharmed from people's contact, a country
with an austere, solitary, and powerful beauty. I lived,
so poor was I, in a little rustic cottage belonging to some
Engadine peasants. I fed on milk, vegetables, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
herbs. I had no one with whom to exchange a word,
since even then the healthy and robust fled from those
stricken with my terrible disease. I wandered along
difficult and rugged paths that no one had tracked;
I drank at the icy waters of the springs beneath the
glaciers; I gathered the mountain flowers which filled
with perfume my little room, and I read a little. In
winter my confinement became fearful amidst the snow
and ice, shut up at first in my room; then mad with
weariness, boredom, and gloom I sallied forth, in the
cruel cold, every day on the snow and ice. After a year
my malady was conquered. The pure, cold air, the pure
water, a life of simplicity and purity, an isolation that
pacifies and soothes, an interior life profound and free,
the treasures that the high mountains jealously preserve,
that are spread out only to humble and devout seekers
after health, silence and peace&mdash;those treasures were
granted me and I was saved. I never left the Engadine
again: I made the renunciation."</p>

<p>She listened to him, silent and moved, her eyes
clouded with tears.</p>

<p>"I renounced every joy and delight, every triumph.
I might have discovered an immense secret of science to
reveal it to a stupid world. I might have signed with my
name a truth still unknown and benefited with noble
gifts the human race; I might have been illustrious and
celebrated&mdash;but I renounced everything. I might have
been loved, I might have loved and founded a family,
had sons, and surrounded myself with beings who might
have been blood of my blood&mdash;I renounced all that. I
might have lived in a metropolis, run through the world,
visited unknown countries, known far-off peoples. I
renounced them; everything I renounced. What am
I, forsooth? A doctor, a wretched doctor, a doctor of
rich consumptives in a summer and winter station. I
am paid handsomely, but I am nothing but a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
doctor who strives to prolong a life here and there as
well as he can&mdash;nothing more. For twenty-five years I
have not moved from here: I am alone, no one loves me,
I love no one; I have neither glory nor love, no sons, no
pleasures."</p>

<p>"And why all this, why?" cried Else von Landau,
anxious and agitated.</p>

<p>"Because one must live as long as possible: because
one must die as late as possible; because one must, you
understand, combat death," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"Did you not suffer from the renunciation? Did you
not suffer from what you missed? Do you not suffer
from what you are missing?" she asked, still discouraged,
but already conquered.</p>

<p>"I suffered <em>then</em>," replied Karl Ehbehard. "I suffered
greatly. These woods and rocks, once so solitary, have
seen my tears. Afterwards I suffered no more. And
now some sweetness comes into my life in this exercise
of my art: if I manage to snatch some infirm creature
from death&mdash;a rare sweetness. But nothing more. So
even renunciation offers at last its compensations. Renounce,
dear lady,"&mdash;and his voice grew a little tender&mdash;"these
joys which are precipitating you towards
death. Seek other things up here for a year or two
amidst natural and pure beauties. Live here in peaceful
contemplation of sky and clouds and air, of proud
mountains and terrible glaciers; of slender streams,
deep woods, and fragrant flowers. Live here with
yourself, creating a more intense interior life. Do you
not see? This land has been invaded by a horde of
pleasure-seekers and vicious people, whereby the sick
and ailing and lovers of the mountains are being overturned
and disappear. The land has been far too much
sown with villas, immense hotels and little hotels, and
has been defiled by railways, electric trams, and funiculars;
in every way the attempt has been made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
destroy her beauty and secret of life. But they will
never destroy them! Her beauty and purity are
eternal and immortal. Ah, renounce the world, dear
lady; later let the pleasure-seekers depart, and remain
alone in the presence of all that is lofty, sincere, and
vivifying. Seek no more the crowd that takes you and
consumes your strength; mix no more with them, fly
from their ardent, sterile pleasures, refuse their vain and
dangerous gifts&mdash;renounce them, renounce them! If
you want to live and be cured, renounce them. Here by
yourself in solitude and silence, in contact with lofty
things, now gentle, now terrible, the great treasure of
health that the mountains guard and concede only to
fervent worshippers will be granted to you. Make the
renunciation or die. I am the apostle of life."</p>

<p>"I will obey you," she said, subdued.</p>

<p>He rose; and with a simple, friendly action took her
hand.</p>

<p>"Your hard sacrifice will later have its reward," murmured
Karl Ehbehard, in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>She questioned him with her beautiful, velvety eyes.</p>

<p>"If he who loves you and whom you love knows how
to wait, he will have you," added Karl Ehbehard.</p>

<p>An intense smile of happiness appeared on Else von
Landau's lips.</p>

<p>"So much was not granted to me," he ended by saying,
sadly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Thoughtfully and dreamily Lucio Sabini was dallying,
stretched in his arm-chair beside his writing-table;
a newspaper had fallen from his hand and
lay opened on the carpet, his cigarette had gone out
and he had not lit another. In the little, sympathetic
HÃ´tel Caspar Badruth, with its rather small rooms,
every summer for some years he had always occupied
the same room, one of the largest and most beautiful,
with two windows looking on to the lake. He had
divided the large room into two parts with a tall screen
of Japanese silk, quaintly bordered with flowers and
plants, animals and figures. On one side the bedroom
was isolated, on the other quite a little <em>salon</em> had been
devised, with his arm-chairs, writing-table, and little
tables, and on this ordinary furniture Lucio had placed
fabrics, vases, photographs, a shining silver writing-<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nÃ©cessaire</i>,
a red leather writing-case, and some pocket-books;
in fact, everything personal and intimate that
can conquer the discouraging banality of an hotel bedroom.
Although the dinner-hour was drawing rapidly
near, Lucio remained in his arm-chair, still in the
dressing-gown he had donned an hour ago on returning
from a walk. His servant, Francesco, who for ten years
had followed him everywhere, and who in the ten years
had especially learned never to direct a remark to his
master except when asked, and then to reply in the
least number of words possible, had noiselessly prepared
on the other side of the screen what was necessary for his
master's evening toilette, even to another cigarette-case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
full of cigarettes and a silk neckerchief to place under
the overcoat, and silently and discreetly had vanished,
shutting the door without noise. Probably Lucio Sabini
had not even been aware of his presence. It was nearly
eight o'clock. There was a knocking at the door. With
a start Lucio, still <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i> and far-away, called out,
"Come in."</p>

<p>"I am come to say good-bye," said Franco GalatÃ ,
entering, and offering his hand to Lucio.</p>

<p>Lucio conjured a vague smile, took the hand, looked
for his cigarette-box, and opened it.</p>

<p>Franco GalatÃ , Prince of Campobello, was a Sicilian
gentleman of thirty-five, who passed but two or three
months of the year at Palermo and one at Licata, where
his property was. The rest of the year he was always
travelling, to Rome, Paris, Biarritz, Ostend; to Monte
Carlo, Cairo, and St. Moritz, always mixing with the
most brilliant society, knowing everything and everybody.
Of medium stature, but lean and robust, very
brown of countenance, with a little spiked beard, and
two very black eyes, slightly bald, a very good fencer,
a perfect and tireless dancer, speaking French and
English, and even Italian, with a strong Sicilian accent,
Franco GalatÃ , Prince of Campobello, at first succeeded
in being attractive; but his attraction did not last.
His acquaintances changed frequently, not from year
to year, but from season to season. People with whom
he was intimate for three months, on the fourth month
greeted him no more, and he himself avoided them,
proudly and mockingly. Friends liked him for a short
time, and then suddenly spoke ill of him, and he, Franco
GalatÃ , spoke ill of them. Women grew agitated in
speaking of him, changed the subject, or withdrew.
Lucio Sabini gave the Prince of Campobello a worldly
sympathy, very uncertain and very superficial, in which
at bottom there was doubt and repugnance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you leaving St. Moritz?" he asked courteously.</p>

<p>"I am leaving this hotel, dear Sabini. I am going to
the Grand Hotel. I waited till they had a room free.
This evening I am going to occupy it."</p>

<p>"Don't you like the 'Badruth'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a regular box. There's nothing to do," exclaimed
the Sicilian.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"With the ladies, I mean to say," explained Franco
GalatÃ .</p>

<p>"Don't you think there are beautiful women here?"
suggested Lucio, becoming very cold and staring at the
Prince of Campobello.</p>

<p>"Here? Very few: well acquainted with me and all,
and I very well known to them. There's nothing to do,"
he repeated, with an even harder accent; "therefore
I am going elsewhere."</p>

<p>"You travel to find women?" asked Lucio coldly,
placing himself in unison with GalatÃ .</p>

<p>"For nothing else," affirmed the Prince of Campobello.
"It is the only thing that interests me, pleases
me, amuses me. I find nothing else better in life, such
as it is," and he sighed lightly.</p>

<p>"And do one or many please you?"</p>

<p>"They all please me, even the least beautiful and the
least young. Those who please me most are the ones I
can't possess," concluded GalatÃ , with a slightly irritable
accent.</p>

<p>"And do you never fall in love?" asked Lucio icily.</p>

<p>"In love? Not at all. I should be silly to let myself
fall in love. Sometimes they believe I am in love; and
sometimes love matters nothing at all to them," murmured
the Prince cynically.</p>

<p>"Therefore you are going to the Grand Hotel," said
Lucio, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Naturally! What is one to do in a small hotel, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
such few people as we are, all acquainted with each
other? Everything is noted and observed, everything
is heard. Hurrah for the large hotels, Sabini! For
every reason there is nothing like them for what I want.
Plenty of unknown or little known women; I unknown
to them or little known; immense <em>salons</em>, immense halls,
vast terraces&mdash;the earthly paradise, my friend, the
paradise of adventures of a day, of three days, of a week,
especially when they are on the point of leaving ...
when they are unlikely to be seen again, you understand,
they dare more easily."</p>

<p>The Prince of Campobello laughed, with his red,
carnal, sensual mouth beneath his black moustaches;
and his black beard shook a little, and his eyes shone
with a desire that was ever satisfied and ever unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"But these women whom you meet on your travels,
dear GalatÃ , are they easy to conquer?" asked Lucio,
with cynical curiosity.</p>

<p>"Ah, not all certainly, my friend; but I try with
all."</p>

<p>"With all?"</p>

<p>"No one excluded. It is my method. I assure you it
is the best way."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Lucio did not interrupt
him.</p>

<p>"I like you so much; come away with me to my
hotel," said GalatÃ  familiarly, not heeding the silence.</p>

<p>"You think so?" murmured the other, fencing, with
the coldest politeness.</p>

<p>"I have got to know that there are some very eccentric
Russian women, also two or three divorced English
women, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-vierge</i> or two. Come, we will amuse ourselves.
Do not remain in this virtuous barrack."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't amuse myself there," declared
Lucio, somewhat decisively.</p>

<p>"What? Don't you like women?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but one at a time."</p>

<p>"Really? And are you capable of loving the one?
Seriously?" exclaimed GalatÃ , astonished and almost
scandalised.</p>

<p>"I am even capable of loving the one seriously."</p>

<p>"For some time? Then you give her up?"</p>

<p>"Later, much later, I give her up ... when I have
ceased to love her."</p>

<p>"What ingenuousness!" exclaimed the Prince of
Campobello, astonished.</p>

<p>"Infantile, infantile! I have no spirit in these love
affairs," said Lucio Sabini, with a sneer; "but I wish
you every success there! You shall tell me about it
afterwards when we meet."</p>

<p>"All you want to know. A pity you won't come."</p>

<p>They took leave of each other at the door. Coming
down the corridor someone was advancing towards
Lucio. He stopped beside him, while the Prince of
Campobello, after a slight, sarcastic smile, which the
new-comer did not see, withdrew with the elastic step
of a good fencer and dancer. With a rearward movement
at the threshold of his room, Lucio Sabini tried
to escape the meeting and conversation with Serge de
Illyne; but he did not succeed. Serge, bending his tall
stature and his beautiful face, said to him in the purest
French, in a musical voice:</p>

<p>"Allow me; I should like to say a few words."</p>

<p>Lucio, with bad grace, was forced to stand aside and
let him pass. Serge de Illyne remained standing because
the other did not ask him to sit down. He was a tall
young man, of almost statuesque figure, in modern attire.
He was already in evening dress, with a stupendous
orchid in the buttonhole and a peculiar waistcoat of pale
green velvet, with oxidised silver buttons. Serge was
of rare masculine beauty, with a very white complexion,
large, dark eyes loaded with melting sweetness, a florid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mouth beneath the soft, light chestnut moustaches, and
a round, white neck. His perfectly shaped, pink hands
were loaded with quaint rings, of antique shape, with
gems of strange colours, and beneath his shirt-cuff a gold
bracelet fell over his wrist, in the fashion of a snake
with carbuncle eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, dear Count Sabini," asked the Russian, in his
sing-song voice, "do you smoke those bad cigarettes?
Let me send you some of my exquisite ones!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Sabini a little curtly, "but I am
used to my own."</p>

<p>The Russian, in a tranquil attitude, with his beautiful
face on which bloomed a smile, was not discouraged.</p>

<p>"Do you use <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau de Lubin</i>?" he resumed. "Why
don't you use a mixture of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ambre</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chypre</i>? I assure
you they are delicious."</p>

<p>And he offered him a pink, bejewelled hand, as if to
make him smell it. Sabini pretended not to notice it.
He neither touched nor smelt the hand and replied
rudely:</p>

<p>"They are perfumes for women, in fact for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cocottes</i>.
I don't like them."</p>

<p>The young Russian shook his head graciously. Then
seeing that Lucio Sabini, staring a little impatiently, was
questioning him with his eyes, he said:</p>

<p>"I came to ask you, dear Sabini, if you would accompany
us after dinner to St. Moritz Bad."</p>

<p>"With you and others? With whom, then?"</p>

<p>"Why, first of all with me, and with Hugo Pforzheim,
you know, dear Hugo, the graceful German, and Lewis
Ogilvie, the Scotch psychologist who has invented the
theory of the music of colours, and James Field, another
friend, an artist of the pencil. His drawings are stupendous;
don't you know them?"</p>

<p>"All your set, in fact?" asked Lucio, restraining his
disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, all our set," murmured Serge de Illyne
candidly; "we are going to Reginald Rhodes's&mdash;you
must know the name, for he is already celebrated&mdash;the
English poet. He has condescended to read us a poem
this evening, an unpublished poem, on a fascinating
subject."</p>

<p>"Which is?"</p>

<p>"'Narcissus' is the title."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Lucio Sabini, at the height of impatience,
"and you want me to come as well? Are there
to be ladies there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" exclaimed Serge, with a gesture of
annoyance; "we never have women with us."</p>

<p>"You dislike them, eh?" sneered Lucio.</p>

<p>"We don't dislike them. We think them vain, silly,
useless creatures," said de Illyne contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, if there are no women I can't come," concluded
Lucio, smiling sarcastically; "I like women's
society."</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dommage, dommage!</i>" murmured the Russian, in
his melodious voice.</p>

<p>"This evening I have a lover's tryst," said Lucio
Sabini roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Serge, as if scandalised, but questioning
with his beautiful, tender eyes.</p>

<p>"Really: a lover's tryst. And I must leave you to
dress," insisted Lucio, still somewhat insolently.</p>

<p>"With whom&mdash;a lover's tryst?" murmured Serge de
Illyne.</p>

<p>Lucio then looked at him with such intense and silent
disdain on his face that the handsome Russian paled a
little, turned on his heels, and departed, bowing his tall
person with the statuesque figure, while Lucio Sabini,
with an energetic movement of the shoulders, disguised
as an offensive farewell, retired behind the screen to
dress. His toilette was, more than usual, long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
accurate. He had almost finished when he heard a
voice calling him from the other side of the screen.</p>

<p>"Sabini, are you ready? Are you coming to
dinner?"</p>

<p>Lucio put forth his head only from the screen and
recognised Francis Mornand, a French gentleman, who
had entered the room without Lucio being aware of it.
Very thin, pallidly brown, with a clean-shaven face on
which a calm and peaceful expression of correctness was
permanently spread, with close-cropped hair, still black
at the forehead, but slightly sprinkled with white at the
temples, with monocle fixed without support, causing
not a single wrinkle to the face, and dressed in austere
elegance, when he was silent Francis Mornand had a more
English than French appearance. But no one ignored
the fact that he was one of the wittiest men in Engadine
society, as of any society in which he happened to find
himself. Everyone knew that, having lived thirty or
forty years in the great cosmopolitan world, with an
iron memory and an extraordinary adaptability of spirit,
he was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conteur</i> without a rival.</p>

<p>"I am nearly ready, Mornand," replied Sabini, with a
smile, "but whither will you lead me?"</p>

<p>"First to dinner with me, then to our place."</p>

<p>"I must dine in haste, because it is late," replied
Sabini, who had again gone behind his screen.</p>

<p>"As you like. Afterwards we will take a turn."</p>

<p>"Where?" replied the other, without any curiosity.</p>

<p>"To St. Moritz Bad, to the 'Kurhaus,' where the
great tenor Caruso is singing for a charity. I have some
tickets, also for you. After midnight to the 'Palace.'
Paul Fry&mdash;you know him&mdash;has arrived, the greatest
cutter at baccarat, who always cuts a five. There is to
be play to-night, when all the ladies have gone to bed.
It is to be a great game&mdash;most interesting. All those
who have no money play hard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't come," replied Lucio Sabini, stepping into
the room, already dressed.</p>

<p>"And why?" asked Francis Mornand, with a little
smile.</p>

<p>"Because I have to go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Elsewhere?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Again Lucio did not reply. He took from a glass vase
a magnificent white rose, a single rose, and placed it in
the buttonhole of his dress-suit.</p>

<p>"You are going to the ball at the 'Kulm.' You are
very much in love with Miss Lilian Temple," said Francis
Mornand kindly, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>Lucio stood still, with lowered eyes, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>"Well, dear Sabini, at any rate if you will dine with
me, since I am all alone this evening, I will tell you the
history of Miss Lilian Temple," declared Mornand, in an
indifferent tone, without even looking at his companion.</p>

<p>"Her history? Her history?" blurted Lucio, with a
tremble in his voice. "Has Lilian Temple a history?"</p>

<p>"See how much in love you are, Sabini!" added
Francis Mornand, chuckling quietly. "Confess that
you love her."</p>

<p>"I adore her," replied Lucio simply.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear fellow," declared the amiable Frenchman,
placing his arm in Lucio's, with affectionate
familiarity, "Miss Temple has no history. She is an
ideal creature; and if I say so you can believe me. But
if you do not cruelly desert me at dinner, I can tell you
the history of Miss Lilian Temple's family, which I knew
well in London. That ought to interest you a lot, if you
really love her."</p>

<p>"I adore her," repeated Sabini, and his words were
veiled with emotion. "Let us go."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>Nearly all the women and girls who had come
that evening to the great ball at the "Kulm" were
dressed in white. In the immense hall that&mdash;with its
richly painted but very low ceiling, the general vastness
of which is broken by strange pillars, broad and
low to support it&mdash;resembles, or is meant to resemble,
an Egyptian temple; in this immense and characteristic
hall, where the whole of one wall opened out on to
a verandah of shining glass, overlooking lake and wood,
a crowd of women kept fluctuating, gathering in groups
or separating amongst the pillars or thick clusters of
green plants, as they sat for a while on the divans
and rocking-chairs, or rose to go to the <em>salons</em> or the
ballroom. And all this whiteness of cambric and silk,
of lace and tulle, of marble and silver united and
melted together, contrasted and harmonised, as if in a
<em>chorale</em> of whiteness, with livelier and calmer shades
or softer blendings of white. In the long corridor
which separates or leads to the hall on the right, with
drawing-rooms and reading or conversation-rooms, and
to the left to the majestic ballroom, on the velvet benches
were two rows of girls and women, nearly all dressed in
white, who were talking quietly to their neighbours, as
they scarcely waved their white gauze and lace fans.
Other ladies in white were coming and going along the
corridor, from the hall to the ballroom, in couples and
groups, chatting in a low voice with whomsoever was
accompanying them. Only here and there appeared a
pale blue dress, or a pink or yellow, to be overcome at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
once by twenty or thirty white dresses. Occasionally
in the quiet corners of the hall, at the back of the reading,
conversation, and smoking rooms, appeared elderly
ladies, dressed in black and in rich, heavy stuffs, such as
black velvet and brocade. On the grey and white head
shone an old diamond ornament, or some old jewel
flashed on the covered bosom, where it fastened a rich
scrap of old lace.</p>

<p>Nothing but English, though of course in different
accents, was to be heard. English and American women
were fraternising; the English, gentle but reserved, the
Americans more expansive and more charming, were
gathered together in the hall and rooms, especially in
the famous corridor, while outside, from the other hotels
of the Dorf and Bad and from the villas, guests began to
arrive. The English ladies of the "Kulm" watched
the arrivals with discreet or even cold glances, and if
they were surprised in the act of watching, they quickly
turned their eyes to another part, detachedly, with that
perfect power of correct isolation which is one of the
greatest spiritual gifts of the English. More happily
curious, the American ladies turned and smiled or uttered
a rapid word or two in a whisper; but no one caught
the comments, so subdued and brief were they. A
French woman, the Marquise de Brialmont, with a
great mass of light golden hair, on which she had placed
a very large hat of black tulle, covered with black
feathers, dressed in black lace, arrived, appeared, and
passed with a rustling of silken skirts, leaving a strong
perfume behind her. Miss Ellis Robinson, amidst a
group of English friends, slowly fanned herself while
her friends got ready. Lia Norescu, as beautiful as a
spring dawn, in a cloudy dress of very pale blue, with
imperceptible silver revers waving like a flower in a light
breeze, with a silver ribbon that surrounded her shining
brown hair, entered, followed by five or six of her suitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and further behind by her silent mother, in the violet
brocade dress of patient and somnolent mothers who
wait evening and night for their daughters to finish
dancing and flirting. Lia Norescu's beautiful mouth
curved in a fleeting sneer of disdain at the crowd of
white-clad English women, some of whom were beautiful,
some less so, others not at all in their dresses which
were too simple and unpretentious, with the fresh flower
in the hair. But none of the English girls seemed to
be aware of her. Madame Eva Delma, a theatrical
celebrity, who earned two hundred francs at each performance,
entered&mdash;she was an enormously fat Australian
who came every year to St. Moritz in the attempt to get
even a little thinner&mdash;dressed entirely in red, which made
her more conspicuous, breathless from the few steps she
had climbed, and followed by a pale, thin little husband.
Other guests arrived, some loudly, others fashionably
dressed, and in spite of the rather too pronounced
splendour or refined elegance of the French, Russian,
Belgian, Austrian, and Italian ladies, the English girls
with their fair hair simply adorned with flowers, and
the American girls with their black helmets of dark hair,
overwhelmed them by their large numbers; and contrasted
with the few red, black, yellow, and blue dresses,
all their white dresses formed the harmony and beauty
of that immense picture.</p>

<p>When Lucio Sabini, after leaving his hat and coat in
the cloak-room, entered the "Kulm" hall alone, he at
once perceived that the ball had begun. The spacious
room, with its appearance of a Pharaoh's temple, was
almost deserted; the bright light of the electric lamps
illuminated the thick clumps of palms, the rich baskets
of flowers which adorned the recesses, and a few old
ladies who were staying behind, lost and swallowed up
by remote corners. He scarcely hurried his step in the
almost deserted corridor, giving a glance to the sitting-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>rooms
on the right, where some old gentlemen and
ladies were reading papers or playing bridge in silence,
while there reached him, now stridently, now languidly,
the burthen of the Boston waltz from the ballroom.
Half-way down the corridor he saw a girlish figure in a
white dress advancing towards him, and he recognised
her at once from afar. He stopped, expecting her to
recognise him as she advanced with bowed head at a
rapid pace; but she only did so when close to him.
A light cry of surprise and emotion issued from Lilian
Temple's lips, and a blush covered her face to the roots
of her fair hair.</p>

<p>"Ah, here you are!" she stammered, perceiving that
by her blushing she was betraying her emotion too
much.</p>

<p>"Here I am," murmured Lucio Sabini, taking her
ungloved hand, and barely brushing it with his lips.</p>

<p>Alone in that deserted corridor they glanced at each
other two or three times. Lilian Temple was dressed in
a white stuff, a light silk that resembled a muslin, which
assumed simple and pure lines with a very slight rustling.
A large white ribbon, knotted behind, formed a belt,
and fell in two long streamers. The corsage was modestly
opened in a round at the neck and bust; it was trimmed
with a fine tulle which gave a cloudy appearance to the
stuff and the transparent complexion. Round her neck
she wore a black velvet ribbon with three little silver
buckles. She had at her waist three magnificent white
roses; in the fair hair, of a childish fairness, which she
knotted on her pretty head in three coils, she had placed
amidst the curls another white rose. Her whole being
breathed youth, freshness, and purity. Everything
about her was more than ever virginal and alluring&mdash;the
deep blue eyes, the transparent pearliness of the face
and neck and bosom, the sudden changes of colour in
the face, and the open and disappearing smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Miss Ford?" asked Lucio at last.</p>

<p>"She is playing bridge with some friends," replied
Lilian slowly.</p>

<p>"Does she like bridge? <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brava</i>, Miss Ford!" he said,
with a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Again they were silent, looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the beautiful flowers," she continued,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>He looked at the roses Lilian kept at her waist and the
rose that was languishing amidst her hair. They were
those he had sent her in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Temple, for honouring my flowers,"
said Lucio, in his subdued and penetrating voice; "I
wear your colours, as you see."</p>

<p>She looked at the white rose he had in his buttonhole,
and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"After the ball, Miss Temple, we will make an exchange.
You shall give me the rose that has been in
your hair or one from your waist, and I will give you
mine, if you like."</p>

<p>Lilian Temple listened with her little blond head
inclined, just like a bird's.</p>

<p>"Will you give me one of your roses?" he asked, in a
still lower and more penetrating voice, "one of your
roses to keep me company after I leave you to-night,
when I am alone in my room? Will you give me
one?"</p>

<p>As if to speak better, he took the little, long white
hand without a glove and pressed it slightly between his
own.</p>

<p>She raised her pure eyes, blue as periwinkles, to him
and replied in a faint voice:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will keep the rose I have worn beside you
to-night, Miss Temple? You will keep it? To remind
you of me to-night and to-morrow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>In his subdued voice there was more than tenderness,
there was ardour, an ardour violent and repressed, as
he squeezed the little, imprisoned hand.</p>

<p>"I will keep it," she said, with a trembling of her lips
that were speaking, and a trembling of her little hand
between those of Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>Someone was coming from the ballroom and from the
hall. He let the little hand fall. Regaining her composure
she said:</p>

<p>"Won't you come with me to the ballroom?"</p>

<p>"Later on, Miss Temple," replied Lucio, still a little
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, at once!" exclaimed Miss Temple gracefully.
"It is a beautiful ball, and full of such pretty
girls, Signor Sabini."</p>

<p>"All English, I imagine. Then they must be very
pretty."</p>

<p>"There are many Americans; but they are very
beautiful too. Oh, I like all this so much," she said,
with ingenuous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"So you like a ball, Miss Temple?"</p>

<p>"Of course," and she smiled with simple, youthful
gaiety.</p>

<p>"And you want to dance?" he murmured, frowning.</p>

<p>"Why, yes!"</p>

<p>"With whom do you wish to dance?" he insisted, a
little seriously.</p>

<p>"With you if you like," she answered, understanding
at last what he meant.</p>

<p>"All the time with me?" he asked, with a stern face,
as if he were imposing a condition.</p>

<p>"All the time with you," she accepted, with a smile.
He was more than ever intoxicated by that smile; but
he knew how to control himself. He gave her his arm
and they proceeded to the door of the ballroom. But a
crowd, of men in particular, cumbered the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and prevented people from entering and leaving; so
they waited patiently till they could enter. They
waited some time, exchanging a few words <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>,
she lifting her little blond head to his, where nestled
the fragrant white rose he had given her, and fixing his
eyes with that glance which bewitched him, so much
did it give to him the complete expression of a fresh,
young, virginal soul, so much did he perceive gathered
there all the moral beauty and loyal tenderness of a
fresh, young, virginal heart. He bent over her, dominating
her with his black, calm, thoughtful eyes, sometimes
crossed by a gleam of passion, with the virile and noble
expression of his brown, rather thin face, but where all
the characteristics were of energy; dominating her with
soft, low words, pronounced in that tone of sincerity
that the more simple womanly ear appreciates and
understands. However, if the man was deeply charmed
and subjugated by her who was beside him, he was an
expert in hiding from the world what he was experiencing;
hence his face disclosed nothing, while she, as she
looked at him and listened to him, appeared in her
silence, even in her immobility and perfect composure,
to be taken and conquered. At last, carried on by a
flow of people that pressed and drove them, they
managed to enter the majestic ballroom together.</p>

<p>Round the walls there was a triple row of ladies seated,
looking on and criticising. The seats were set very close
together and the women were elbow to elbow and shoulder
to shoulder, and among them, behind, were the men
very close together, scarcely seated on a corner of their
chairs, or standing and occupying the least space possible,
hidden behind skirts which spread themselves, showing
only their heads between two ladies' shoulders, bending
on one side to talk to the lady they were beside, while
the ladies raised their heads with a gentle movement,
smiling and showing white teeth, occasionally raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
their fans to the height of their lips, as if to hide from
strangers their smiles, to show them only to him who
was beside them. At the back of the room were eight
or ten sets of men and women who had found no seats,
but who kept close to each other in couples, waiting
patiently to find a seat or to dance together. In the
middle of the room, in a broad vortex that grazed those
who were seated around, that made those who were on
foot draw back from its whirl, in a broad vortex that
grew longer according as it followed the longer walls of
the room or grew denser along the shorter sides, in a
vortex, now soft, now rapid, now denser and now thinner,
many men and women were dancing, with a revolving
of white dresses and black suits, while the triple hedge
around alternated with black and white. Blond heads
with delicate faces and blue eyes, a little bent as if to
follow the music, revolved now softly, now quickly;
gentle feminine figures in the whiteness of gauze and the
brightness of silken girdle, revolved amidst the clouds
of white skirts that wrapped themselves round their
slender persons. The faces of the men&mdash;some young
and others not so young&mdash;drew nearer to those of their
partners in the musical rhythm, as strong or graceful
arms upheld them in a firm embrace: a male hand
pressed a little white-gloved hand in support. The
heads of the English girls, adorned with flowers, were
sedate, and sedate were their rosy faces, while their
figures as they danced preserved a chaste appearance,
as if the pleasures of the dance were nothing to them.
On the, for the most part, clean-shaven faces of their
partners a perfect correctness was to be noted. And all
those blond heads of the women and clean-shaven faces
of the men, the hundred or two hundred couples, of
cavalier and lady, of girl with bright eyes, and youth
with large mouth and perfect teeth, as they stood or
sat down, danced or rested, seemed to have silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
sworn never to separate that night, and this with the
most perfect naturalness.</p>

<p>In drawing-rooms and sitting-rooms mothers, aunts,
and relations were reading papers they had already read,
or were playing at bridge, while many of them slumbered
with eyes open, blinking from boredom and weariness;
but none of them were troubling about their
daughters and nieces. The young women and girls, the
demoiselles of thirty, and the scraggy old maids touching
forty, in white dresses, with hair curled in front and
ribbon round the neck, from the moment the ball began
were accompanied by lads and youths or older men with
whom they were flirting. They did nothing but chat
with, smile, or look at their flirt, or dance with him or
another flirt, in perfect liberty and composure, each
couple to themselves, without troubling about the
flirting of their neighbours, nor did their neighbours
seem to be aware of theirs. They were amusing themselves
with that English tranquillity that is so astonishing,
because it resembles boredom&mdash;the couples were
pleased with each other, but with a gentle seriousness
in acts and words and an occasional fleeting smile.
Perhaps they were in love with each other, as many
people love each other in other countries, that is to say
with secret ardour; but so secret was it that nothing
escaped thereof, showing instead a serenity that seems
genuine, and perhaps is, and though they experience
love's tumult in the depths of the soul, they have the
strength to control that tumult.</p>

<p>More impulsive and impetuous, the actions of the
American girls with their admirers and flirts were livelier,
their words deeper and their laughter more frank. A
keener life palpitated in their eyes full of gaiety, in their
nostrils which seemed desirous of inhaling every perfume
and in their parted lips. They shook their heads of
dark hair, whose waves were peculiarly lowered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the forehead, and their actions were coquettish as they
offered their ball programmes, opened their fans, or
took their partner's arm. In their dancing there was
no stiffness of movement, and no angles. They danced
to perfection after much practice in their own country,
with a frank pleasure that was expressed in their glance
and laughter, and a ready grace and freedom that was a
little superb. To their suitors and flirts they imparted
an almost Southern <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">brio</i>, and a flow of youth and love
emanated from them, compared with the coldness and
reserve of the English couples.</p>

<p>Thirty or forty couples whirled round to the tune of
the "Boston" waltz, and the slender feet of the American
girls, shod in satin and transparent stockings, appeared
and disappeared amid the flowing lace petticoats, while
their partners and their flirts smiled at them in manifest
pleasure that nothing could conceal. Amidst the somewhat
baptismal cambric dresses, with their heavenly
bows, pink and yellow, of the three English sisters,
Evelyn, Rosamond, and Ellen Forbes, passed Miss
Katherine Breadley, the American in the Empire gown,
so disturbing in its too audacious lines and so seductive,
as well, on the arm of her French flirt, the Comte de Roy,
the youth of a great princely house, whom she smilingly
called Monseigneur. By the Misses Atwel, the little
English girls dressed in white, on whose heads were
withering wreaths of myosotis, passed in dancing Miss
Betty Finch, the enchanting modern Grecian of Fifth
Avenue, in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crÃªpe de Chine</i>, smiling at the Vicomte de
Lynen, her Belgian flirt and partner. There crossed the
room without dancing, but with the authority of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
vieux garÃ§on</i> who has toured the world and known the
whole of society, Miss Ellis Robinson, accompanied
step for step by her Italian flirt, Don Carlo Torriani,
who has sworn to make her renounce celibacy; and the
enormous solitaires of the American woman shone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
curious contrast with the little gold crosses of the
English girls. But in Britannic form, in American, in
European, in every form, only flirtation governed and
dominated, enveloped and transformed, that dance at
the "Kulm" on that summer evening. Lia Norescu,
the exquisite creature in her blue dress, the flower of
beauty, surrounded by her court, having found other
courtiers there, passed from one to another, dancing
like a sylph on the meadows almost without touching
ground, with her light feet shod in pale blue. She
danced in the middle of the room, the better to be seen,
the better to be admired, and intoxicated her cavaliers
with her smile, one after the other of whom she dismissed
but who returned to her subdued, and whom
she took back in a most capricious game of flirtation.
The Comtesse de Brialmont, as she danced with the
Count of Seville, a Spaniard, who was said to be the
nephew of an ex-queen, a morganatic nephew, whom
she had seized from a friend of hers, bit her lips as she
almost dragged her partner along in the "Boston."
Suddenly even Eva Delma, enormous, like a great
Caryatid, sallied forth to dance with a graceful youth
whom she devoured with her eyes. English flirts,
American flirts, European flirts, caprice, light love, love,
passion, fair heads and brown heads, chaste gowns and
audacious gowns, hands interlaced and shoulders too
near, tender smiles and intoxicating glances, beauty of
innocence and conscious beauty&mdash;how everything exhaled,
emanated, and spread in the air, penetrating
senses and hearts that night in the ball at the "Kulm"!
Suddenly a couple appeared in the middle of the room,
and a large circle was reverently made. They were
Mrs. and Mr. Arnold, both seventy, who had been
married for forty years. She, with her completely white
hair and rosy face, was most attractive; he was less
white, but more robust and red in the face. For forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
years these two people had never left each other, and
they had come to St. Moritz from time immemorial.
They had been guests at the "Kulm" ever since its
foundation. Every year they suddenly sallied forth to
dance, she composed and serene, he elegant in his
strength. And Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, in their flirtation
of ten lustres, seemed to be the symbol of all the flirtation
of which air, light, flowers, women and men were
formed and transformed that night of the ball at the
"Kulm." Smiles and discreet English applause greeted
the couple; the Americans, laughing, applauded more
loudly, but few of the other nations did so. And around
the two almost a hundred couples began to dance,
amongst whom were Lilian Temple and Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>Lilian danced well, but with some stiffness, as if
through reserve she were unwilling to yield herself to
the too brilliant tunes to which the dancing couples
whirled ever more gaily, as if unwilling to yield to the
too soft harmonies that seemed to strike with an almost
amorous languor those who were dancing. Erect like a
light stalk, hardly supported at the waist by Lucio's
arm, Lilian Temple turned her head a little on one side,
as if unwilling to meet her partner's gaze. Lucio Sabini
danced to perfection, with that sense of musical rhythm
which belongs to all Italians, and with a virile grace
that emanated from every act of his; and he fixed his
eyes on his lady's face, while he impressed on her, with
an arm that scarcely guided her, a rapid or a softer movement.
At first surprised and then annoyed to find her
without response, and without a tremor, in a dance that
he rendered ever more enticing, amongst the crowd of
women and men who were nearly all transported, not
only by the enjoyment of the dance, but by a more
intimate and more secret joy, he suddenly said to her
in the rather rough voice of his moments of ardour,
which always appeared in contrast to his feelings:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does dancing bore you, Miss Temple?"</p>

<p>"No, Signor," she murmured smilingly, "on the
contrary, I am very fond of it."</p>

<p>"Then you don't care about dancing with me?" he
suggested, even more roughly.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?" she asked, blushing a
little, lowering her eyes, with a veil of sadness in her
voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied vaguely, "I don't know;
I thought so."</p>

<p>They turned more quickly; he raised her as if he
wished to make her fly, and she, even more lightly,
scarcely seemed to touch the ground; a fine smile
parted her rosy lips, trembling a little at having to
dance so fast, and for an instant her deep blue eyes,
pure and tender, fixed themselves on the brown, thoughtful
eyes of Lucio Sabini. It was only a fleeting smile,
the glance of an instant, but, disturbed and moved, he
asked her:</p>

<p>"Do you like dancing with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, very softly.</p>

<p>She said nothing more. The graceful face recomposed
itself into its serenity, and the dance ceased. In
silence he offered her his arm, and without even asking
her went towards the ballroom door, desirous of leaving.
But other couples had left for the corridor, some slowly,
others hurriedly, to look for a quiet corner. Lucio,
accustomed to command, hid his annoyance with the
people he found everywhere; Lilian followed him in
silence, without questioning, allowing him to lead her
where he willed. In the middle of the corridor Miss May
Ford came towards them, as she left a small sitting-room.
She was dressed in black satin with a magnificent
white lace scarf on her arm and a jewelled flower in
her sprinkled hair. She had a gentle but composedly
affectionate smile for Lilian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"The game is over, darling. It is late, I am retiring,"
she said, in a quite English tone of simplicity. "Are
you staying?"</p>

<p>"I shall stay, dear," replied Lilian simply.</p>

<p>"I expect you will stay till the end, darling?"</p>

<p>"I expect so too," replied Lilian frankly.</p>

<p>"Then good night, dear. Good night, Signor Sabini."
Miss Ford withdrew with that freedom and indifference
which astonishes anyone who is not English, and which,
instead, is the expression of their respect for other people's
liberty and their own. And Lucio, pressing Lilian's arm
lightly beneath his own as they went towards the hall,
said:</p>

<p>"Now you are in my hands, Miss Temple."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, frowning slightly and lowering
her eyes.</p>

<p>He stopped, corrected, a little confused, and recognised
his mistake.</p>

<p>"I have said something wrong, Miss Temple."</p>

<p>She became silent; as it happens at times when one
has an unpleasant thought, and from politeness one
does not wish to utter it.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Miss Temple: I beg pardon frankly.
I am thirty-five, but sometimes I am a naughty
boy."</p>

<p>Still she was silent, and a little pale.</p>

<p>"Tell me that you forgive me, Miss Temple: tell me
that, I beg of you," he exclaimed agitatedly. "You
know I am a boy sometimes."</p>

<p>She gave a friendly little nod of the head, but nothing
more. And he understood he could ask no more at that
moment. They entered the hall; but still there were
people round all the little tables where during the day
tea was taken. Other couples were seated beneath the
thick clumps of green plants; others were further off
towards the corners of the immense crypt that reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
one of the monuments of Sesostres and Cleopatra&mdash;everywhere
a man and a woman. Lucio and Lilian gave
a long sweeping glance at the hall, the same glance. They
had the same singular expression of fraternal sympathy
with the surroundings and the people. They made the
same mutual movement in turning and going back to
the corridor, seeking together, without saying so or
confessing it, a more secluded, solitary spot. After
wandering in the corridor for a little in silence, while
from the ballroom the call of a very lively two-step
reached them, they entered one of the reading-rooms.
The hour was late: they only found an old lady there
reading a review with silver-rimmed glasses bent over
her nose, and a tiny little lace cap on her white hairs.
An old gentleman in another corner was reading the
"Norddeutsche Zeitung." They neither turned nor
raised their heads when Lucio and Lilian entered very
quietly and sat down far-away from the two in a corner;
she in an arm-chair of dark leather, he in another which
he drew much nearer to hers. And their words proceeded
in almost a whisper so as not to disturb the two
old people who were reading.</p>

<p>"Are you cross with me, Miss Temple?" he asked
humbly.</p>

<p>With her little hand she made a polite gesture that he
should speak no more of the matter.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>"I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Are you my friend?"</p>

<p>She looked at him and made no reply.</p>

<p>"As at first, I mean to say," he corrected himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, as at first," she murmured thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Lilian kept her slender hand on the arm of the chair.
He watched the old lady with the silver glasses and the
old gentleman with the flowing beard. They neither
turned round nor saw: they were immersed in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reading. Then he placed his hand on Lilian's. She did
not withdraw it, and he gave a sigh of joy.</p>

<p>"You must be very indulgent and merciful to me,
Miss Temple," he said, with a rather sad accent. "Sometimes
I seem wicked, sometimes&mdash;far too often&mdash;I seem
perverse."</p>

<p>She looked at him with her beautiful, candid eyes.</p>

<p>"It is the ancient man that arises, Miss Temple; a
man who has suffered and caused suffering," he proceeded
sadly. "I need kindness and pity so much to
be a good, loyal man as I was once, as I should like to
be again."</p>

<p>"Whatever are you saying?" she asked, marvelling,
and a little anxiously.</p>

<p>"You have the salvation of my soul in your hands,
Lilian," he said to her, in so serious a tone that she
could not think of being offended because he had called
her by her name so suddenly.</p>

<p>More than ever anxiety disturbed the beautiful, soft,
virginal face.</p>

<p>"Do you laugh at this humble hope, Lilian? do you
laugh at this immense hope? Do you wish me to save
myself to end by losing myself?" he continued, in that
serious, touching tone of his.</p>

<p>"Who am I to do this?" Lilian asked, hesitating and
trembling.</p>

<p>"You are innocence," he replied, bowing as before
an image, "and you alone can save me."</p>

<p>"How can I do that?" she stammered, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"You know," he continued, with so ardent a glance
that she felt herself scorched by it, from her eyes to her
palpitating heart.</p>

<p>"Come," he murmured in her ear, "let us go and
look at the summer night outside."</p>

<p>They rose quietly; the old lady was still absorbed in
her review reading through her silver-rimmed glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of which they had never heard the pages turned, and
the old gentleman was hidden behind his large German
newspaper, held by a stick like a paper banner. Neither
of them had been aware of the presence of the two lovers,
or discreetly had pretended not to be aware. As in a
dream, with a far-away look in her large blue eyes, Lilian
Temple followed Lucio Sabini. Silently, automatically
they looked for her mantle and shawl, which were hanging
on a peg in a corner of the corridor. Lucio helped
her to put on the white woollen cloak, with the long
sleeve-like wings prettily trimmed with white fur. He
settled the shawl on her head, made of an Eastern fabric,
in white gauze trimmed with silver spangles. Together
they directed themselves towards a deserted room near
the hall, whose balcony opened on to the large covered
terrace, and large verandah with pillars: the verandah
that stretched along the main body of the HÃ´tel
Kulm, facing the lake. They did not exchange a single
word, walking slowly as if absorbed. Opening the window
of the balcony behind them and leaning over the
balustrade, without moving they contemplated the
spectacle which in solitude and silence was beneath
their dreamy eyes.</p>

<p>The night was already late, a pungent cold, with
breezes that seemed like powerful, icy gasps crossed the
silent Engadine country. The pure night air was
rendered quite white by the lofty brilliance of the
moon, suspended over the lake like a lamp in mid-sky.
Meanwhile the mountains around, far and near, were
becoming obscure and gloomy with shadows, and even
higher and more majestic in the gloom those that the
moon did not touch and illuminate, while the opposite
shores of the lake, untouched by the moon's rays, grew
gloomy; in the middle its waters, touched by the moon,
were scintillating. All the lake of St. Moritz, in fact,
seemed like a strange cup of peculiar liquid, black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fearsome towards the deserted shores, beneath the
shadow of the mountains, brilliant as a cold, metallic
liquid in the middle; a fantastic cup containing intoxication
and death on the cold summer night in the high
mountains. Like night and moon the silence was
supreme and everything seemed motionless. Up above
a few scattered lights pointed the way from the station
to the baths, but no human shadow passed there.
Down below at the baths rarer and feebler light flickered
now and then, if a too impetuously cold breeze reached
them. In an opaque, almost spiritual, whiteness the
eternal snow appeared high above, in the night, on the
strange Piz Languard; pure and spectral it appeared
amidst the deep folds of Monte Corvatsch, and pale as
a phantom on the far-off horizon between the two peaks
of the Margna. Their souls trembling with an immense
sensibility, their hearts palpitating with an immense
tenderness, were struck, seized, and conquered by the
majesty and purity of things in the presence of the
mountains that for centuries have seen time and life
pass away; in the presence of the motionless glaciers
that no sun's rays could dissolve, and the waters black
as shadows or white as the moon. Side by side, they
felt their hearts lifted above every little transient,
paltry entanglement by so much power, beauty, and
nobility; they felt that their hearts were breaking old
bonds, and that the secret of their spirit was more
intense, profound, and overpowering. They felt that
here was the master whom nothing could any longer
resist, and that no longer could they lie or remain silent.
Sweetly Lucio bent over her and sweetly he drew her
to him with a light fleeting action, as he brushed the
fair hair on her forehead with his lips.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Amore mio!</i>" he cried in Italian.</p>

<p>Lilian Temple became as white as her dress and veil,
and white as the eternal snow of the mountains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>"Hoop-la!" cried Mabel Clarke joyously. And bending
over the neck of her yellow-dun horse she urged
him to a trot; Vittorio Lante also brought his horse,
a powerful black, to a trot. The amazon and her
cavalier trotted side by side for some minutes in a
cloud of dust. Descending by the hill that separates the
Dorf from the valley of Samaden, going through the
little shady, peaceful wood, grazing the tall hedges,
fragrant with aroma beneath the matutinal dew, Mabel
Clarke brought her horse to a walk and Vittorio Lante
imitated her. But when the American girl issued from
the wood on to the high road, where the broad valley
of Samaden opens out, she perceived that the two
equipages, the large white brake and the victoria, containing
the rest of the party had made great progress
and were hardly to be distinguished, being ahead beyond
Celerina and on the way to Pontresina; she felt a sudden
rush of infantile impatience, and inciting her horse
and the cavalier who accompanied her, she wanted to
catch up and pass the two carriages.</p>

<p>Dexterously firm in the saddle, in a dark blue habit
which made her seem taller and slimmer, and a most
attractive dark blue doublet, fastened by tiny buttons,
with a white collar fastened by a big gold pin, with a
tea rose in her buttonhole, and a round straw hat, surrounded
by a blue veil that even restrained the thick,
riotous, chestnut hair, and floated behind in transparent
blue waves, gloved in yellow deer-skin, booted exquisitely,
Mabel Clarke was more than ever fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in her florid beauty, in her graceful vigour, and vibrant
youth. She did not look at the very bright, almost
white, morning sky, a sky of an ineffable softness. She
took no heed of the fresh air, so sweet to breathe; and
she cared not for a sun that was very bland, whose rays
were bright without fierceness. She gave herself up,
in happy unconsciousness, to the joy of being young,
healthy, beautiful, of guiding and being guided by a
strong horse, faithful and safe, passing at a steady trot
along the broad road, amidst the meadows soft with
dew, only turning every minute to see if her cavalier,
Don Vittorio Lante, were following closely. That perfect
cavalier, who was trotting with ease and youthful heedlessness,
was quite close to her, scarcely bending over
his horse, smiling every time at the softly blue-veiled
face of Mabel Clarke, who smiled at him for a moment.
In the buttonhole of his riding-coat he had placed a tea
rose; beneath the brim of his soft grey felt hat a peaceful
countenance revealed itself, and an expression full of
happiness that was reflected from his glance. His surroundings,
with their charm of air and light and perfume,
did not affect him; or perhaps they reached him through
his dream. Twice with a gesture of fastidiousness the
amazon and her knight were forced to rein in their
horses, putting them to a walking pace, to pass the little
village of Cresta and the district of Celerina, in the
narrow, twisting, badly paved streets. But when once
again they emerged on to the high road and had passed
the sounding wooden bridge over the Inn, they yielded
themselves to a strong trot, again inciting and urging
each other, always gaining more ground on the carriages.</p>

<p>"Go! go! go!" exclaimed Mabel Clarke gutturally,
in English.</p>

<p>Already this gay chase was perceived from the
carriages, and many-coloured parasols and white handkerchiefs
were to be seen waved in greeting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
brake; the two ladies in the victoria turned their heads,
more tranquilly, as if to encourage the proud riders more
pacifically, who were advancing and suddenly reached
and passed the victoria, Mabel Clarke sending a kiss
with the handle of her whip to Mrs. Clarke and a nod
to the other lady, Mrs. Gertrude Milner, Don Vittorio
Lante bowing and saluting with his whip. They overtook
the large brake, skirting it, the one on the right, the
other on the left, where, laughing and gesticulating,
Ellen and Norah West, Susy Milner, and Rachel Rodd
jumped up to welcome them, as well as several young
men, who in French and English also welcomed them in
pleasant, jolly terms, while Mabel and Vittorio, on their
part, laughing and calling out a little, responded to all
the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>For a long portion of the road there was a war of chaff
between the brake and the two riders as they came up or
passed from time to time, an exchange of greetings and
apostrophes in French and English, the girls pronouncing
Mabel's name a hundred times, and she shaking her
beautiful brown head as she smiled and laughed, her
veil swelling behind her in blue waves, while Vittorio
Lante played his part in regulating his black to Mabel's
yellow-dun; and even he was amused by the playful
briskness of their chaff.</p>

<p>Annie Clarke and Gertrude Milner in the victoria more
quietly contented themselves with a kindly wave of the
hand or a nod of the head or an indulgent little smile
when Mabel and Vittorio passed them. Annie Clarke
was wearing a light grey dress of masculine cut and a
round hat, wrapped round with a light grey gauze veil;
beneath her white collar on the dark tie, knotted in
man's fashion, a very simple pin was fixed, an enormous
shining black pearl, a unique jewel. Gertrude Milner
was austerely dressed in black, but on the white lace
which formed the yoke of her waistcoat she wore a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
string of large pearls, which she never took off. People
said that Gertrude Milner even wore these pearls at night
when she slept.</p>

<p>As they sped towards Pontresina neither the amazon
nor her cavalier, nor the young girls in the brake, nor
the ladies in the victoria seemed aware of how they were
leaving behind them the meadows of Celerina, the
distances of Samaden, and the heights of the Muottas
and the Corvatsch; the profile of Pizalbris to the left,
and to the right the curve of the Fuorcla, the deep woods
that alternate with arid glebe and stones and rocks, and
the white Flatzbach, that milky, tumultuous torrent
which comes from the white Bernina. They seemed not
to see how in grandiose and solemn line the two mountains
opened, to show the gigantic Roseg glacier in a
bluish whiteness beneath the bland sun. Perhaps the
fresh, caressing air, the vault of heaven brighter than
ever, and the soft morning light vibrated within them
as intimate and secret elements of serenity, content, and
subtle intoxication. But none of them wanted to, or
knew how to, take account of these hidden influences.
They enjoyed everything without analysing, and the
strong desire of arriving quickly at their goal possessed
them. The horses of the riders, of the brake, of the
victoria, urged on by spur and whip, sped on to arrive
together more quickly than anyone had ever made the
journey, with the headstrong anxiety of always being
first, which is one of the forces of the American race.
The maids and youths in the brake were annoyed at
every other vehicle, and tried to pass them, urging on
the driver, the robust Joe Wealther, the fiancÃ© of Ellen
West. Mabel and Vittorio were annoyed with whatever
they met in the way, an obstacle to their race; and
with smiling and mischievous eyes they exchanged, the
American and the Italian, their impetuous desire of
ever speeding ahead, as they disturbed groups of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pedestrians, and scattered clouds of dust over the other
carriages. In the victoria Annie Clarke and Gertrude
Milner, the two peaceful and dignified matrons, grew
weary of all the other road-farers; they drew the rug
over their knees in a distracted and distant manner,
appearing to be not the least aware of other wayfarers
on foot or in carriage. They grew proudly weary,
desiring quietly, as the others desired ardently, to reach
the Morteratsch glacier quickly, whither all were
directed, and where they must see everything in the
shortest time and return at once to St. Moritz Dorf for
luncheon at the Palace Hotel.</p>

<p>"The lunch is execrable here at the glacier restaurant,"
Annie Clarke declared, with a knowing air.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of all their American hurry, on entering
that strange district of Pontresina, studded with little
wooden houses, in two rows, as if from a child's box of
toys, carriage and riders were forced to go at a foot-pace.
The row of carriages became much longer&mdash;hotel omnibuses,
barouches coming and going in every direction to
and from the Roseg, towards Samaden and the Bernina.
Even denser were the people on foot, who came and
went, and grouped themselves at the doors of the hotels
with their hundred rooms, before the cafÃ©s and the confectionery
shops&mdash;a bizarre crowd, so different from that
of St. Moritz.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">TrÃ¨s inÃ©lÃ©gante</i>, Pontresina," declared Gertrude
Milner, in her turn, with American gravity.</p>

<p>However, they were forced to halt in the square before
the Post Office, like all the other carriages, to let the
horses have a moment's breather. The girls in the brake
clamoured for the famous chocolate truffle of the Pasticceria,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A Ma Compagne</i>, so their two cavaliers jumped
from the brake to go and fetch some; two others went
for a whisky and soda. Vittorio Lante patiently
allowed his horse to drink at a fountain near by. Mabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
approached her mother's carriage and bent over her as
fresh as a flower.</p>

<p>"Happy, Mabel?" asked the mother tranquilly,
scarcely smiling.</p>

<p>"Most happy, mammy, very happy!" exclaimed the
daughter.</p>

<p>Smiling, chatting, and exchanging chocolates and
caramels, the girls in the brake pretended that Joe
Wealther should make the horses go furiously on leaving
Pontresina; but he imperturbably kept an even pace
in spite of their protests. Mabel and Vittorio again
trotted briskly, and even the peaceful victoria was
transported at a trot. Beneath a sky increasingly pale,
as if a great pallor had been diffused beneath the blue,
with the light of the sun now veiled, the countryside was
profoundly changed. A broad, deserted valley, between
two rows of black, rocky mountains, opened out, and
stretched monotonously and sadly. Here and there a
rare herb grew between the rocks with some big, dusty,
yellow flower. Stones were everywhere, from the little
pebble to the massive boulder, heaps of dry earth were
crumbling, and little mounds of black earth concealed
the meagre course of a stream which now and then reappeared,
weak and tinged. So silent was the sadness
of that valley, and the death of everything lively and
gracious, that behind her blue veil Mabel's grey eyes
grew disturbed and she felt the need of breaking the sad
silence that oppressed her, and of hearing the voice of her
cavalier.</p>

<p>"Do you love all this, Lante?"</p>

<p>They were alone, sufficiently far from the carriage;
their horses close together, head to head, relaxed their
pace to the reins held slackly in their hands.</p>

<p>"I love you, Miss Clarke," he replied promptly, with
an unwonted impulse, more passionate than sentimental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you even love me here, in this arid, gloomy
place?" she asked, as if another, a more intense amorous
declaration were necessary for her, to conquer,
perhaps, the melancholy that weighed her down, or for
some other mysterious uncertainty of her soul.</p>

<p>"Here, and everywhere, and always," he said
seriously, as if he were proclaiming a shining truth and
pronouncing a sublime oath.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed simply, as if in a dream.</p>

<p>For an instant, almost in a dream, Mabel bowed her
head, as if she wished to drive away every molesting
care. She pulled sharply at her horse's rein, to resume
a more rapid pace.</p>

<p>The carriages approached. Mabel and Vittorio distanced
them again. The man was silent and thoughtful,
as if disturbed at what had bubbled forth from his soul
in a cry of sincerity. She was silent, watching him now
and then, as if to scrutinise his thoughts and feelings,
because the accent, which had been more earnest than
she had previously heard, had reached her. The horses
trotted head to head.</p>

<p>"Is this the Bernina road, Lante?" she asked in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Clarke," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Then it is the road to Italy?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, to Italy, Miss Clarke."</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence. He leant his head
towards her and said to her in a voice she had never
heard before:</p>

<p>"Miss Clarke, shall we gallop to Italy? Together,
alone, to Italy, Miss Clarke?"</p>

<p>She looked him frankly in the eyes, wishing to penetrate
his heart and soul. And he withstood well the
woman's glance, directed sharply at him in its desire
to know the truth. A light laugh issued from her young
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, Miss Clarke? It is not right to
laugh so," he exclaimed rather harshly.</p>

<p>The laugh changed into such an affectionate and
sincere smile that without her speaking he understood.
He added anxiously, but with happy anxiety:</p>

<p>"Would you come, Miss Clarke? Would you come?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I would come, Lante," she replied, again
become serious.</p>

<p>"Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will come," she added gravely.</p>

<p>Pale with joy, he stooped and suddenly clasped her
hand and kissed it in an act of devotion and dedication.
Nothing more was said. The brake full of girls and
young men came up to them, who continued to chatter
and laugh, emitting guttural exclamations, to conquer
the desolate solemnity of the country through which
they were passing, and up to them came the victoria
where Annie Clarke and Gertrude Milner had drawn
on their heavy fur capes, since the sky was now an
immense pallor above the great valley rough with
boulders and rocks, and the sun, that had become a
spectral pallor over the naked, rude mountains, had
made them feel cold. Everyone in carriage and on
horseback sighed with relief as, making the last stretch
of road, wooded like the avenue of an oasis in such an
austere landscape, they smiled at the foaming, sounding,
clamorous cascade that in a little gorge among the trees
comes from the Bernina and penetrates underground,
and further off reappears a torrent, and becomes
lower down a river. After a few paces all had to
descend.</p>

<p>A wooden bridge was the extreme limit for carriages
and horses. To reach the glacier it was necessary to go
on foot.</p>

<p>"Is it impossible <em>for all</em> to drive?" asked Gertrude
Milner, very scandalised in her American dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible, dearest Gertrude," replied Annie Clarke,
shaking her head. "If you are tired we can stop at the
restaurant."</p>

<p>"The glacier is very badly managed," murmured
Miss Milner, offended in her habitual laziness and her
American <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>.</p>

<p>"Very badly," agreed Mrs. Clarke, who never liked
walking.</p>

<p>They began to walk slowly after the young people.
The party walked rapidly, in couples and groups, Mabel
far in advance of all, lifting over her arm the train of her
riding habit, showing her slender little feet and some of
her leg. Vittorio was beside her, not leaving her for a
step. But in the frank sense of respect for another's
liberty, which is one of the noblest things in American
social life, none of the party bothered about them. Not
even Mabel's mother seemed to be aware of the very
open love-making, even in its correct form. Ellen and
Norah West's mother had remained at Sils Maria,
allowing her daughter, Ellen, to go alone with her fiancÃ©
Joe Wealther. Mrs. Gertrude Milner worried not at all
about the flirtation of her daughter, Susy, with Pierre
d'Alfort, the witty and amiable young Frenchman, who
fascinated the girl by the originality of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boutades</i>, and
much less did she trouble herself about the flirtations
of her niece, Rachel Rodd, with the Vicomte de Lynen,
the Belgian, a troublesome and ever-deluded hunter
after a big dowry, who even here was making a false
move, for Rachel Rodd was very poor, with only a
dowry of one hundred thousand dollars. At times the
couples met and formed large groups, whence issued
jokes and laughter, only to separate spontaneously and
correctly. Only Mabel and Vittorio, who had dismounted,
started off at a brisk walk, as if they did not
wish to be overtaken; but no one followed hard on
them, for they took care to keep the distance, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
one called after them. Suddenly, however, the party
halted to look around.</p>

<p>The Morteratsch valley opened out on two sides, on
which the mountain larches climb to a certain height,
slender and brown, with supple branches; higher up the
sides rose even more naked and less green, until quite
high up they were delineated against the sky, to right
and left, in massy profiles of dark rock. In the middle
distance and the background, in gigantic, white, rugged,
naked cliffs, in colossal undulations, that had been immovable
for centuries and for centuries covered with
snow, as hard as the rocks it hid, the glacier opened out,
arose, advanced, and took up all the horizon; it advanced
like an immense white wall, and then like an
immense black wall, forward, forward, as if it were
walking towards the onlooker, towards the rapt, ecstatic
crowd in front&mdash;an immense peaked wall that seemed
of rock but was really of ice. Three majestic peaks
stood above it: on the left the Piz Bellavista, on the
other side towards the left the Piz Morteratsch, and
finally, very lofty, fearsome, and white without a scar
or rent, the queen of mountains, the virgin of mountains&mdash;the
Bernina.</p>

<p>Here, round the little one-storeyed restaurant, with
its tables spread in the open air, some beneath an awning,
round a kiosk, where post cards and little souvenirs of
the Morteratsch were on sale, a whole squad of silent
people were contemplating the glacier. Before it lay a
stretch of ground, covered with big and little rocks
brought there by the winter avalanches; amid the
boulders ran a meandering torrent, while to the right
was a faintly traced little path among the rocks which
higher up, as it approached the great black wall of the
glacier, disappeared; and nothing but stones and water
proceeded from the glacier, where a gloomy grotto was
hollowed out, which seemed like a speck in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why is the glacier so black in front?" Gertrude
asked Annie, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"It is covered with rocks and earth," was the reply.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dommage</i>," murmured Gertrude in French.</p>

<p>For some minutes the enchantment of the glacier
remained over the crowd that was admiring it, silent and
astonished. Then figures began to separate, attracted
as by a magnet, and set out for the small path, while
other figures more in advance were already there, small
and diminishing, flitting from rock to rock&mdash;little black
specks of beings who were at the grotto or coming from
it. The coming and going was continuous; the men
gave their hands to the ladies to make them walk more
safely, or preceded them to point out the best way, while
the lofty wall, all white in front, all black above, and
finally at the horizon white with reflections of metallic
blue and gold, in altitudes and precipices which seemed
the monstrous waves of a sea petrified for ages, caused
the crowd of visitors to seem even more tiny and miserable.</p>

<p>"We will stay here," said Annie Clarke to the party.</p>

<p>"We will stay," approved Gertrude Milner.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir, mama</i>," cried Mabel to her mother from
afar, as she approached the glacier, accompanied by
Vittorio.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir, au revoir</i>," exclaimed the young people
of the party as they left.</p>

<p>Quietly seated at a restaurant table, beneath the
awning, Annie Clarke and Gertrude Milner took a cup
of tea to warm themselves, watching, without troubling,
the figures of their daughters ever growing smaller, as
they proceeded over the sharp rocks, along the torrent,
towards the glacier.</p>

<p>Around them at the tables some were taking tea,
others were drinking beer, and others writing on post
cards. People arrived continuously from the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
behind the bridge where the carriages were halted, and
others arrived from the glacier. Everywhere nothing
but German was to be heard, and the very waitresses of
the inn were frÃ¤ulein who did not understand a word of
English or French.</p>

<p>"Even here all are Germans," murmured Gertrude
with a sneer, as she sipped her tea.</p>

<p>"And Jews! What a nuisance, dear," added the
very Catholic Annie.</p>

<p>Mabel and Vittorio had almost reached the goal. As
they approached the way became more dangerous amid
the great rocks which had to be jumped, and from which
it was easy to slip. Mabel's high heels made her hesitate
and vacillate every moment. Frowning and anxious
about making a stupid fall, she ended by placing her
two hands in Vittorio's, although at first she had refused
any support; then in three leaps she reached the opening
of the ice grotto with him. He made her climb the
last boulder, lifting her like a child, as he deposited her
on a mound of earth, and so gracefully that she smiled
at him adorably to thank him. The immense wall stood
over their heads; through two enormous clefts they
perceived its fearsome height and profundity. The
enormous walls were dripping icy water, and drops of
icy water fell from the arch of the cleft, whence was
formed the strange grotto. Near at hand, beneath a
colossal and sinuous streak of ice, which was the tail of
the glacier, the torrent bubbled forth mysteriously and
sped away. They penetrated beneath the white arch
that overwhelmed them, amid the ice that surrounded
them with a cold embrace; the gelid drops fell on their
cheeks and foreheads. Vittorio felt Mabel's hand
trembling a little as it sought his.</p>

<p>"Would you rather go out?" he asked, guessing her
secret wish.</p>

<p>"I would rather," she replied at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>They completed the short circuit of the grotto and
left. She was pale as if she breathed with difficulty
under the immense wall; and she breathed deeply, in
fact, when once again she was on rocks in the open air.
She perceived a little road that climbed among the
boulders to the right.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, approaching Vittorio.</p>

<p>It was not an easy or short ascent for her cavalier
to a promontory which arose to the side; and they still
met people who were descending, chatting harshly in
German, while further off the rest of the party followed
them. Turning suddenly, they perceived that they had
climbed higher than the wall of the glacier, and that it
was spreading before their eyes from top to bottom in an
immeasurable breadth, bounded on the right by two
great moraines of black rocks, all white in the middle,
and at the back climbing, heaping, sinking, rugged and
profound, towards the two lofty peaks of Bellavista and
Morteratsch, towards the beautiful and virginal Bernina,
the mistress of the mountains. They sat down on a
large rock, and both were seized and conquered by the
solemn, majestic, and terrible spectacle. They were
alone; before them was the potent immensity of things
that had lasted for ages and would last through the ages.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mabel Clarke turned to Vittorio Lante and
asked him in a clear, precise voice:</p>

<p>"You really are free, Lante?"</p>

<p>He looked into the quiet eyes that questioned him and
replied sincerely:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am free, Miss Clarke."</p>

<p>Mabel still contemplated for a moment the whiteness
of the far-away ice and the purity of the neighbouring
snow; her accent was again firm and fierce as she asked:</p>

<p>"You are poor, are you not, Lante?"</p>

<p>There rose before the eyes of the Italian gentleman the
more than ever impressing spectacle that elevates souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and exalts them to supreme truth. Beside him was a
creature of truth and beauty. From his ardent heart
there burst forth a pure flame of truth. Courageously,
without shame and with simplicity, he declared:</p>

<p>"I am very poor, Miss Clarke."</p>

<p>Mabel smiled as never before, and her hand brushed
Vittorio's in a grateful, loyal, pure caress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>"Miss James and I prefer to drive and wait for you at
Sils Maria," quietly said Miss Ford to Lucio and Lilian.</p>

<p>The girl remained impassive; Lucio Sabini bowed,
in token of consent. The carriage which an hour ago
had brought all four to the hill of the Maloja and had
waited for them there&mdash;as after having traversed the
highway and the hill paths they reached on foot the
top of the great wall of a peak which divides the Grissons
from the Val Bregaglia, to the lofty gallery of rocks
covered with moss and yellow marguerites, whence the
gaze is directed down below towards Italy&mdash;and which
was to bring them on the return road, first to Sils Maria
and then to St. Moritz, was drawn up at a few paces from
the Kursaal Maloja. Suddenly turning from that strange
gallery whence, now and then exchanging a fleeting
glance, Lucio Sabini and Lilian Temple had both gazed
at the road to Italy, and while they drew near the vast
lake which stretches from the Maloja to Sils, Lucio had
proposed crossing the lake by boat as far as Sils Maria,
while the empty carriage should go on and wait for them
there. Lilian, without speaking, blushed one of those
blushes of joy that mounted in a wave of emotion from
her neck right to the roots of her fair hair. Miss Ford,
after having exchanged three or four words in English
with her companion, had quietly announced her desire
to go in the carriage with her, leaving the boat trip to
Lilian and Lucio.</p>

<p>While he accompanied the two old maids to the
carriage, he was once again astonished in the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
his mind at the ever-increasing freedom with which
Miss May Ford, who was Lilian's guardian and friend,
often, very often, left the girl alone with him. Now and
then, with his Italian mind accustomed through heredity
and tradition to keep women, and especially girls, under
a rigorous surveillance; accustomed to consider woman
in general as a prisoner who strives constantly to escape
and around whom iron chains must be multiplied, a
strange impression struck him when he discovered that
Miss Ford entrusted Lilian Temple to him and Lilian
trusted him, when their love-making had now become
so marked that in no way was it possible to conceal it,
and he very nearly felt irritated at Miss Ford's desertion
of Lilian and very nearly sneered at the perfect confidence
Lilian had in him. A flood of evil thoughts was
poisoning him. But afterwards he thought of the
admirable rectitude of the English character, which,
incapable of failing, does not believe that another can
fail; he thought of the profound respect that all Englishmen
have for women, above all for their sweethearts and
fiancÃ©es; he thought of the respect that all the English
have, and have taught the Americans to have, for the
liberty of others; and he felt vulgar sentiments to be
dissolved in his spirit, and ugly thoughts and mean
considerations. He experienced instead the secret
emotion of a man who feels himself esteemed and loved.
Moreover, a singular tenderness invaded him, as he
guessed the truth; that Miss Ford, aware of their love-making,
wished to provide them, in perfect good faith
and generosity, with a means of getting a better understanding,
in a solitude that had for witnesses the sky,
the mountains, the lakes and meadows.</p>

<p>"At Sils Maria, then," he said, with a gracious bow
as he closed the door, giving Miss Ford a grateful look.</p>

<p>"In front of the HÃ´tel Edelweiss," she replied, giving
him and Lilian a friendly nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>They watched the carriage depart and slowly proceeded
towards the lake.</p>

<p>"Miss Ford is very fond of you, Lilian," he said, in a
tender voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, without further remark.</p>

<p>"And I believe you are very fond of her."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>He restrained a little movement of impatience. The
imperturbability, the silence, and the sober replies of
Lilian Temple at certain moments irritated him; the
composure of the beautiful face seemed indifference to
him; the scarcity and the moderation of her words
seemed to him coldness and her silence lack of feeling.
Then he would speak to her in a sharp voice and say
violent and sarcastic things as if to startle her. An
expression of wonderment and pain on Lilian's face
would calm him and make him realise the truth, that
he was in the presence of a different soul, a creature of
another race and another land, and a profoundly different
heart.</p>

<p>"At any rate you will like to sail on the beautiful
lake? Or does nothing matter to you, Lilian?" he
said to her, with a mocking smile and in an irritated
tone.</p>

<p>"Of course it matters to me," she murmured, looking
at him with her dear, blue eyes, rather sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said at once, softening again. "I
am very exacting, I know, but sometimes you are so
English, dear child."</p>

<p>"I thought," she said, with a mischievous little smile,
"that English women were not displeasing to you."</p>

<p>"I adore them!" he exclaimed, in a sudden transport.</p>

<p>They sat in the stern of the rather large boat, which
was rowed by two men. The boats were Italian and
came from the Lake of Como, being transported up
there every year to the lakes of Sils and St. Moritz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
climbing from Chiavenna on the large carts that ascend
there every day at the beginning of the season, and are
re-transported below in the middle of September. The
rowers were Italians&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Comaschi</i>. A white awning protected
the boat from the sun. For some time while the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Comaschi</i> rowed, cleaving the quiet waters, Lilian and
Lucio were silent, letting themselves go to the train of
their slow passage across the lake and the sequence of
their intimate thoughts. Lucio especially liked to be
quiet beside Lilian. When he was with her&mdash;and in the
week after the ball at the "Kulm" he had seen her
every day for two or three hours&mdash;a profound sense of
sweetness kept him silent: the Italian words which
should have told of his flame remained suspended on his
lips; the impetuousness of his love became placated in
the presence of that pure young beauty and in the complete
sentimental dedication which he recognised in
Lilian. He was gladly silent. Moreover, an intimate
terror of saying too much consumed him, of expressing
too much, of showing too much, what manner of thing
was the sudden transport of love that agitated him. He
feared by pronouncing definite words to make Lilian
understand and himself understand, alas, how he was
seized and conquered beyond caprice, beyond flirting
and love-making: he feared lest she should be deeply
discouraged, and he himself feared to be discouraged
by a revelation that he preferred to leave latent and
concealed. Instead an infinite sweetness came upon him
in Lilian's company, in solitude and in silence. Her
presence filled him with a tenderness that surpassed
every other feeling: he understood in those moments
how he would have liked to have invoked the passing
of life thus beside her, and how she carried in her hands
and heart and eyes, in every act of her person, the truest
and most lovable gifts of existence. The boat proceeded
quietly across the limpid waters shining in the sun, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
both continued to dream their soft and quiet dream.
Lilian gently clasped a bunch of Alpine flowers which
she placed upon her knees, on her white cambric dress.</p>

<p>"Lilian, have you seen the Val Bregaglia, and amidst
the light, white clouds Italy, Lilian?" he asked her
softly, as if in a dream, placing a particular stress of
sweetness as he pronounced and repeated her name.</p>

<p>"I have seen it," she replied softly.</p>

<p>"Do you love Italy, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied.</p>

<p>Nothing more. But he felt how much that soul and
heart were his, even in the modesty and moderation of
her words, even in her reserved attitude and pure
actions.</p>

<p>"There is another spot where my beautiful country
can be seen," he added; "a spot loftier and more
austere."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the Bernina pass, Lilian."</p>

<p>"Is it far?"</p>

<p>"Two hours and a half by carriage, perhaps three
from St. Moritz. I think you have never been up
there."</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>"Will you go there with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied at once.</p>

<p>"We will go, we will go," he exclaimed, a little disturbed
with joy. "Up there there is a solitary height:
one must go there on foot after leaving the carriage.
But one sees the Val di Poschiaro&mdash;beautiful Italy!"</p>

<p>"We will go," she again consented.</p>

<p>A boat came towards them, also propelled by two
rowers, proceeding, however, very slowly. A woman
was within, alone, with a delicate, pale face, a rosy
mouth slightly livid, and two deep blue, velvety eyes.
She was Else von Landau, who was enjoying in silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and solitude the air, the light, and the trees, whatever
was healthy and pure and refreshing. With her gloved
hands crossed over her knees, and her veil raised above
her hat, she appeared collected and serene. With calm
eyes she followed the boat with the two lovers.</p>

<p>"She is ill, poor thing!" murmured Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>"But she will get better," added Lilian, "if she
remains here for the winter."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"The doctors say so, people say so. One gets better
here in the winter. How beautiful it must be here
beneath the snow," she murmured, as if to herself.</p>

<p>"Would you come here? Would you pass a winter
here, Lilian? You are not ill, Lilian!"</p>

<p>"Of course I am not ill," she said slowly. "But I
should prefer to be here rather than in England. There
is sun here."</p>

<p>"But our country is Italy, the land of sun!" exclaimed
Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>"That is true," she said, looking at him, expecting
another speech.</p>

<p>But he added nothing more. After a moment he
resumed.</p>

<p>"Aren't you happy, Lilian, in England?" And he
scrutinised her face keenly.</p>

<p>"Who told you that? My father is so good!" she
exclaimed, with unwonted vivacity.</p>

<p>"You love him, and he loves you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I love him, and naturally he loves me."</p>

<p>"And your stepmother: is she good?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, seeing that he knew her
family history, but she quickly resumed:</p>

<p>"My stepmother is good, too."</p>

<p>"But you cannot understand her, I believe."</p>

<p>"That is not her fault," she replied, with some
vehemence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it is yours?"</p>

<p>"Not that either. It is no one's fault. It is so."</p>

<p>Lucio was immensely struck by her directness of
character and generosity. He knew how unhappy
Lilian Temple was in her family and how the father, too
weak to defend and protect her, preferred to give her
plenty of money and a trusty companion in Miss Ford,
to let her travel as long as possible.</p>

<p>"You have a very beautiful soul, Lilian," he said,
with deep emphasis.</p>

<p>She made no reply; her eyes were veiled with tears.</p>

<p>"You deserve to be happy, dear."</p>

<p>"I am happy," she said, looking at him and smiling
amidst her tears.</p>

<p>He grew pale with love, as their row towards Sils
Maria, where the two old maids were waiting for them,
ended in a gentle movement, that almost seemed a
gliding upon the waters. Both more moved than at
any other time, more touched in the deepest essence of
their souls, by that beautiful hour, by the landscape of
peace and grandeur, by the words they had pronounced,
by those they had not said, they experienced in every
glance they exchanged, in every rare accent and gesture,
an emotion they strove in vain to calm. Seated beside
her, his head a little bent towards her, Lucio Sabini said
nothing, but everything within him expressed the
immense sympathy which bound him to the dear
creature, so blond, so rosy, in her white dress beneath
the white veil of her white hat: everything within him
showed that the fascination of that beauty, of that
candour, of that purity had subjugated him. Seated
beside him, a figure of indefinable grace, there was in
her eyes and smile that abandonment of fresh hearts,
that abandonment which is so touching, because it is
that of a heart which gives everything blindly for life
and death. They pursued their gentle voyage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
green peninsula of Sils, and only a few sentences of the
deepest tenderness now and then interrupted it with
alternate silences.</p>

<p>"You will always dress in white, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"If it pleases you."</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>"You are only twenty, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, twenty. And you are thirty-five, you told me?"</p>

<p>"So old, Lilian!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter: it doesn't matter!"</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>"Shall I see you this evening, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"And to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, too."</p>

<p>"Always, then, Lilian? Always?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>Theirs was a sweetness even too intense, and a languor
even more overwhelming; while Lilian's eyes of
periwinkle-blue were far-away, and a little trembling
Lucio's lips. A dull grating on the ground and a rush
of water where the boat had grounded at Sils: rising,
they again repeated the grand word, as if in a dream.</p>

<p>"Always! Always!"</p>

<p>They went through the meadows of thick grass, along
the narrow canal that unites, as it cuts a long strip of
earth, the large lake of Sils with the smaller lake of
Silvaplana; they walked like somnambulists immersed
in a dream of fervid youth and palpitating exhilaration;
they went hand in hand with rapid steps to join the
two ladies who were waiting for them up there beyond
the bridge; towards the large, green wood before the
charming, bright houses of Sils Maria, houses all adorned
with galleries, balconies, and little windows. They
went with steps ever more rapid, because the very pale
sun was setting in too clear a sky, and for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they observed with distracted and wandering eyes the
pallor of sun and sky.</p>

<p>Miss May Ford and Miss Clara James were seated in
the outside, covered vestibule of the HÃ´tel Edelweiss
which was all adorned with flowers; they were seated
at a table and were taking tea placidly and waiting.
Two men were with them; one was Massimo Granata,
the Italian, one of the oldest lovers of the mountains
and sojourners in the Engadine, with his face of an old
child, that is rickety and ill, where above the yellowishness
of the rugged skin, above the scanty, colourless
beard and bony cheek-bones, only the eyes had a ray
of divine goodness, while his awkward body, badly
dressed in a coarse grey mountain suit, abandoned itself
on a seat as if disjointed, while his knotted, shrunken
hands were sorting bunches of fresh edelweiss on a
table and making nosegays of them; the other was
Paul LÃ©on, an Italian by origin, whose family must have
been called Leone at Perugia, whence he came, but which
had been changed into LÃ©on after living thirty or forty
years in France&mdash;Paul LÃ©on, the French poet, much
discussed and much admired for his lofty genius, his
pride, and his wit, now of a cutting irony, now benevolent.
At Sils Maria they found Miss May Ford, with a
tender and sensible soul beneath a cold appearance, and
Miss Clara James, the daughter of England's greatest
spiritualist, an illustrious philosopher and poet who had
died three years previously, but who was not dead to
his daughter, since she spoke with him every night or
believed she spoke with him, and she had remained an
old maid so as to be able to have communication with
the world of spirits; Massimo Granata, who every day
made long walks, had climbed the most impenetrable
paths and scrambled up the steepest rocks, solely through
this invincible love of his of the mountains and his loving
quest of mountain flowers; and Paul LÃ©on, the friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Miss James, who despised the follies of the sojourners at
St. Moritz Bad and scoffed at the cosmopolitans of the
"Palace" and the "Kulm," and who in his poetic pride
lodged in a little inn at Sils Maria and every day went
to watch the little window where Friedrich Nietzsche
had worked for fourteen springs and summers in a very
modest furnished house, and in a very modest room of
that house, Paul LÃ©on who loved the country and that
district where he had come for years, every year withdrawing
from the advance of the ever-invading crowd
from district to district in the search for solitude, who
loved Massimo Granata as an ideal type of moral beauty,
and admired Miss James for her noble, daughterly
hallucination.</p>

<p>The circle grew larger when Lilian and Lucio arrived;
the greetings were sympathetic, for all knew and understood.
May Ford offered tea, as was natural, to Lucio,
who to please her accepted, and to Lilian, who refused
sweetly. Massimo Granata offered Lilian a large nosegay
of edelweiss, gathered two hours ago not far from
the glacier of Fexthal, gathered with his fleshless, rickety
hands that had such soft gestures, as he touched the
flowers gathered after a four hours' walk to "Edelweisshalde."
Lilian pressed and immersed her rather too
heated face in those delicate, glacial flowers, like stars,
as if to seek there a refuge for her ardour. And scoffing,
gracious, efficient Paul LÃ©on, who had been Lucio Sabini's
friend for years, incited him to fence in a dialogue and a
diatribe against all the people who come to live a life
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã  outrance</i> in a land of simplicity and peace, against the
snobs who nowadays penetrated everywhere, who
climbed the virgin heights and disturbed the sky and
earth and waters of the Engadine. Paul LÃ©on, a little
mocking, a little serious, took Lucio Sabini, since he
was fashionable, a born aristocrat, and because of
the surroundings in which he lived, and as an annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
frequenter of all the great cosmopolitan meeting-places,
for a representative of all that world <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã©c&#339;urant, dÃ©gÃ´utant,
oui, dÃ©gÃ´utant&mdash;il n'y a pas d'autre mot</i>. To his amazement
Lucio Sabini was silent and smiled, without defending
that society of fictitious and real millionaires,
of real Princes and Serene Highnesses, whose kingdoms
are as large as kerchiefs, of false beautiful women, of
false rich women&mdash;everything false, everything artificial,
everything sham up there in a land of truth and purity.
Lucio, as if absorbed, made no replies. At a certain
point when Paul LÃ©on cursed, with a sarcastic and refined
curse, the lie of those people, whose impetuous and
atrocious motto was, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Evviva La Vita</i>, Lucio started
and replied simply:</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous avez raison, mon ami.</i>"</p>

<p>Paul LÃ©on gave a fleeting glance at Lilian Temple and
smiled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>On the golf links that extend from the extremity of the
HÃ´tel Kulm, climbing and descending the whole of the
hill of CharnadÃ¼ras, and which are so green that not even
the players' feet have succeeded in making them less
green, early in the afternoon the slow, strange parties of
golfers kept appearing, to the wonderment of bystanders
who did not understand the game, as they leaned over
the little hurdles and watched with staring eyes which
at last became tired and annoyed at understanding
nothing. They kept appearing, to the surprise of wayfarers
who stopped a moment to see a man in white
shirt-sleeves or in a bright flannel waistcoat with long
sleeves, advancing along the course, sometimes directly,
sometimes obliquely, holding his club in his hand, stopping
as he brandished it in an aimless blow, and then
resuming his way, followed always by a boy who carried,
by a shoulder-strap, a leather bag, which seemed like a
pagan quiver; a silent, patient boy, who regulated each
step to that of the player, who crouched sometimes as he
did, and finally vanished in his wake. Continuously
from the green beneath the great tent of the Golf Club,
where the inexpert remained to take lessons under the
direction of two or three professionals, the players started
whither the game and their more or less skill led them,
and their rough outlines grew less and less in the far
distance, till at times the links, or the horizon, became
perfectly deserted, as if no players existed, as if they had
been dissolved by the air or swallowed by the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
The spectators who had come, as if on some doubtful
invitation, to see a game of golf, saw the man and woman
disappear without understanding the reason, and shrugging
their shoulders they departed, laughing at and
mocking golfers, particularly the Germans, who laughed
among themselves and with their wives; more especially
because it was an English game the Germans found it
idiotic, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">itiote</i>, as they pronounced it, when they wished
to talk French. And the wayfarers, after a minute of
contemplation and waiting, went again on their way,
especially as they read on certain wooden posts the
notice: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prenez garde aux balles du golf.</i>" Balls?
Where were the balls? How? The golfers, when they
made a stroke, seemed to be assailing the air as if with a
sudden movement of madness, and afterwards they
looked like solitary vagabonds who were walking without
a fixed goal, in spite of the respectful and silent companionship,
at ten paces distance, of the urchin laden
with the bag of clubs.</p>

<p>Those who played in the early afternoon were truly
solitary lovers of that curious sport which obliges one to
walk much in silence, in a sustained and concentrated
attention, in the open country, in a peculiar search for a
ball and one's opponent, in a broad horizon, neither
feeling heat nor cold, exercising not only the muscles,
but even a little&mdash;really a little&mdash;the intellect. They
were great solitaries, who fled from society because they
frequented her too much at other times of their day;
great solitaries who loved contact with the open air and
fields and woods, in contrast with the confined, heavy
life they were forced to lead elsewhere; great solitaries
who for a secret reason, sad, perhaps, or tragic, but
secret and dissembled, now hated man and woman;
great solitaries whose age and experience had divorced
them from games of love, of vanity, and perhaps of
ambition. In fact, the early golfers were the real, keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
golfers, and for the most part middle-aged men and
women. Among such were the Comte de Buchner, an
Austrian diplomat, a pupil of Metternich, who perceived
but did not wish to confess the end of the diplomatic
legend, the end of a policy made by ambassadors, a septuagenarian
who already felt himself dead amongst his
ancestors; the Baron de Loewy, from London, of the
powerful Loewy bank, who sometimes held in his hand
the whole of European finance, a handsome, robust man
with white moustaches, full of spirit, who passed hours
out of doors at golf, and who came there to find equilibrium
for his winter life as a great banker; Madame
Lesnoy, a woman of sixty-five, who had made her fortune
thirty years ago, and though <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une grande bourgeoise</i>,
had married her sons and daughters to the greatest
names in European heraldry, and who now had nothing
else to do but play golf by day and bridge by night; the
Marquis de ClÃ©an, whose wife had been killed two years
ago with her lover in an hotel at Montreux, a story which
tortured his life of worldly scepticism and over which he
dared not feign cynicism; the Contessa di Anagni, of the
best society of Rome, who had been loved by a King and
had been unable to fix the heart of the volatile sovereign;
Max and Ludwig Freytag, for whom Karl Ehbehard,
the great doctor, had ordered this exercise, as being
excellent to stimulate their weakened temper; the
Comtesse Fulvia Gioia, who thus even better preserved
her health and mature beauty, like that of sappy, ripe
fruit; and so many others who at two and three o'clock
deserted their rooms and hotels and directed themselves
to the links and shortly afterwards disappeared in every
direction&mdash;great solitaries, true golfers.</p>

<p>Towards half-past four, in the meadow which skirts
the high road from the Dorf and extends beneath the
terrace of the Golf Club House, in that meadow which
was almost like a stage, the players increased in number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in couples and groups, not going far-away, always returning
to the meadow, where at that evening hour there was
a pretence of playing golf. It was a theatre whose pit
was the Dorf high road with its footpath and wall, behind
which people who were passing stopped to watch, whose
big and little boxes were the big and little terraces of the
Golf Club, where tea was taken from half-past four to
six. The keen and serious players had been away for
two hours and perhaps had returned. The make-believe
players at tea-time represented the comedy of the game
under the eyes of a hundred spectators, turning continually
to the terraces, greeting and smiling at a friend and
beginning with an important air to hit mightily at a
golf-ball which never left the ground, because they
either missed it or gave it a laughable little hit.</p>

<p>Not far-away, in the spacious tennis-courts, where
from the 18th August to the 24th the Engadine Cup was
contested in the Tournament, games of tennis, singles
and doubles, proceeded at every hour, from lunch-time
till the evening. Truly, tennis was played everywhere,
at every hour, by hundreds of enthusiasts throughout
the Bad; in front and behind the hotels, and everywhere
one went, in the beautiful broad roads of the Bad,
amongst the beautiful broad gardens of the HÃ´tel du
Lac, around the "Kurhaus," around the "Victoria,"
appeared courts with players of both sexes, dressed in
white, and the fatiguing exclamation was to be heard&mdash;"Play!"
But where this passion became delirious was
down below at the Tennis Tournament grounds near the
"Kulm." Still, the tennis-court, like the golf links,
became a theatrical scene towards half-past four in the
afternoon. At that hour, on the left side of the HÃ´tel
Kulm, the tea-tables, already set and decorated with
flowers, were placed in the broad space which borders
the courts. People began to climb from the Bad and to
arrive from the other hotels and villas of the Dorf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Everywhere the crowd increased; some of the tables
which had been placed together held twenty or thirty
persons. The usual German element came and mingled
with the great ladies and great snobs, their imitators,
attired curiously, wearing rough garments and dusty
boots, with a proud, mocking smile, as they talked
loudly in German, and forcibly occupied the best seats,
brutally turning their shoulders to the ladies, and sometimes
smoking pipes. Play went on, but they were show
games of young maidens who wished to be seen and
admired, of women who affected the pose of sport after
having tried so many poses. There were games as of a
theatrical performance played by actors, if we may say
so, for whom tennis was a pretext and an excuse for
chatting and talking at liberty, for isolating themselves,
for donning a different dress, for making acquaintances,
and especially for showing themselves to all the princesses,
marchionesses, ladies, and serene highnesses.
That day in particular there was a game of great parade,
because as Katinka Orloff, a beautiful young Russian of
twenty, elegant and robust, the best player of the season,
and champion of the Engadine for two years in succession,
was retiring after having played a great deal in
practice for the Tournament, an intermediary, an
Austrian Baron, came to tell her that Her Imperial and
Royal Highness, the Archduchess Maria Vittoria, desired
to play with her, naturally only to learn, for she
was so much weaker. Being very tired, the Russian
hesitated for a moment, then she accepted.</p>

<p>It was a great tennis rehearsal, and the tea-tables, with
their half-filled cups, were deserted by the ladies, and
snobs who imitated them. A crowd gathered round to
watch Maria Vittoria, who at first played slowly and
cautiously, then more rapidly, her blood coursing beneath
her brownish, nobly pallid cheeks, her white skirt
twisting round the long slender feet, while Katinka Orloff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dexterous but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i>, now and then allowed herself to
be beaten, resuming the lead for a moment, only to lose
it again. With heightened colour and a gleam in her
dark, pensive eyes, the Archduchess of Austria exerted
herself amidst the complacent murmurs of admiration
of the true ladies, and male and female snobs, and with
a happy little cry the game ended. Politely Katinka
Orloff, who knew the protocol, allowed herself to be
beaten. Proud and silent the Archduchess stretched
out her hand to the Orloff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On mountains, houses, and lake, on golf links and
tennis-court the grey, purple twilight descended. The
white dresses of the lady players seemed to dissolve and
become fantastic, and the dark clothes of the men in the
distance became shadows. The terrace of the Golf Club
was almost deserted, with tables overturned on every
side and chairs in disorder. In a corner, separated by a
group of people who were just about to depart, Mabel
Clarke and Vittorio Lante were saying some subdued
words. Nor were they looking at the links which they
had never looked at. They troubled not about the
company, which troubled not about them. They were
unaware of the twilight hour, and did not observe the
failing light around them. The sunset shadows descended
upon the tennis-court. Players put on their
heavy, dark wraps over their whites, stuffed their
rackets into cases, and left, silent, tired, but content.
Not far-off, in the deserted square, Lucio Sabini and
Lilian Temple were taking leave of each other on the
return from Sils Maria, without speaking, eye to eye,
and hand in hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>From the 2nd of August the Palace Hotel, which is the
supremely characteristic, fashionable, and snobbish hotel
of the whole Engadine in general, and the two St.
Moritzes in particular (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Palace</i>, as the French said, with
an accent of reverence as if they were mentioning Olympus,
<em>the Peles</em>, as the English said rapidly and simply, <em>the
Pelesh</em>, as the American ladies pronounced it, with rich
accent), was filled with its many-souled, multiform, and
original <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientÃ¨le</i>, and was not failing its great tradition,
that of providing everybody, great or small, cause for
gossiping, or mere tittle-tattle. Certainly on some days
the second cause, the little one, was lacking, and on
others the tittle-tattle; but, nevertheless, the tradition
was maintained intact, the causes for daily gossip had
scarcely ever been less than two, and each day that
waned had always had its great news. Generally, when
the weather was very fine, and everyone had left their
rooms to sally forth in the open air, if only to descend
on foot to the Bad and return by the tram, when even the
soft and lazy Egyptian women, with their magnificent
black eyes, pale faces, and intensely rich, though sometimes
tasteful, dresses, were outside the hotel, although
only at the door, making a pretence of coming
and going, the daily scandal had been but one, which
was born and prospered at lunch, was most robust at
dinner, and flourished the rest of the evening, only to
perish at night. But on the days of the 9th and 10th of
August, on which it had rained, and on the 11th, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
which it had snowed slightly, when even the most intrepid
pedestrians like the Comtesse Fulvia Gioia and
Donna Carlotta Albano had remained at home in the
hotel, when neither Madame Lawrence, nor Madame
Lesnoy, nor the Marquise d'Allart had been able to play
golf, when even all the men had stayed at home, to drag
out the time in chatting, smoking, and playing poker,
bridge, and billiards, in these three days of closure the
scandals had been three new ones every day, after even
those of the preceding day had been revived. And every
day the clients of the Palace Hotel, each in their own
set, when they met in the morning or later at lunch, after
some vague words about health or the weather, took up
at once the usual, unchangeable question and answer:
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ChÃ¨re amie, connaissez vous le potin de ce matin?</i>"&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh,
ma chÃ¨re, mais je ne sais rien du tous, dites-le moi
donc.</i>"</p>

<p>However, not all the women and men, old and new
clients of the Palace Hotel, were gossips. Some of the
women, if not many, kept decidedly aloof from all this
scandalmongering, and despised it secretly. Very many
of the men, through refinement of spirit and education,
had the most complete indifference, even insensibility to
scandal. But the serenest women who, because of the
beauty of their interior life were accustomed to keep
their minds free from everything trivial, allowed themselves
to be taken by the slight, childish deceit which the
curiosity of friend or enemy offers to women. Even the
most insensible of men consented, through cold courtesy
and polite condescension, to become worldly and pretend
an interest in the first, second, or third scandal of the
day. The Marquise di Vieuxcastel, most exquisite, of a
delicate beauty, through a double elegance, moral and
material, through a lively taste for art and letters, fascinating
in every grace of mind and person, was not a
gossip. The Comtesse Pierre de GÃ©rard and the Baronesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
de Gourmont, two sisters, could not be gossips, both were
of a classic though different beauty, both were dowered
with characters full of energy and sweetness; each of
the great ladies showed pride in every expression, especially
the first, the famous Comtesse Pierre, a perfect and
conscious pride. The Duchesse de Langeais, for whom
the care of her beauty and an amiable desire of pleasure
hindered every other expression of mind, was not a
gossip. Nor was the GrÃ¤fin Durckeim, the eccentric
Hungarian, whose life was a romance, though completed.
Nor was the Duchesse d'ArmaillÃ©, who was goodness herself.
These and other ladies could not be soiled by the
pitch of scandal, but involuntarily, through curiosity,
through politeness, or so as not to be accused of prudishness,
they listened but heard not in the presence of
the really powerful scandalmongers&mdash;the Comtesse de
Fleury, all beautiful without and unclean within, Frau
von Friedenbach, an old lady of the Court at Berlin who
had been dismissed for her political indiscretions, which,
in the main, had fed the German socialistic press, the
terrible old Baronesse de Tschudy, who had travelled
for forty years and knew four million scandals about
four thousand people she had met. Everywhere, before
all the scandalmongers, these proud, quiet, frank, good
women could but yield for a moment, allowing themselves
to be seized for an instant by a childish and
always illusive curiosity, and by a sacrifice to worldly
politeness.</p>

<p>As for the men, who for the most part, and far more
so than the women, were immune from scandalmongery,
they gave way, not only because of the obligations of
social life, not only so as not to be singular and to show
themselves complacent, but perhaps to please certain
ladies of the Palace Hotel or ladies outside, which they
could not succeed in doing except by gossiping with more
or less wit. It was impossible to pay court to Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Lawrence&mdash;the lovely professional beauty of the year&mdash;a
useless court, as a matter of fact, in results, but which
deceived only in its appearance, without telling her all
the scandals which had been invented and were passing
to and fro about her. It was impossible to see her interested
or smile unless they repeated all the grotesque
and perverse things which the other women had invented
or were inventing about her. It was impossible to enter
the circle of Madame d'Aguilar, the rich and munificent
Brazilian&mdash;who every day had ten people to lunch and
fifteen to dinner, had three carriages always at the disposal
of her friends, and gave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillons</i>, with gifts of great
value&mdash;without being mettlesome, or a witty chronicler
of the rarest scandal. It was impossible to accompany
on a walk the little Marquise d'Allart, pale and pink like
fragile Dresden china, but greedy and hungry and thirsty
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i>. She would exclaim peevishly: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais n'en
savez vous pas un d'inÃ©dit, de potin? Rien que les vieux,
les usÃ¨s? Allons, cherchez, cherchez!</i>" Giorgio Galanti,
an Italian gentleman from Bologna, whose wit was as
fine as a hair, very quick, a fascinating <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conteur</i>, had found
a method, the secret of which he offered to those who
had no other, of conquering the feminine spirit. He used
to go day and night outside the "Palace," into the other
hotels of the Dorf and Bad, wherever he had discovered
a beautiful woman or a pretty girl, and after a conversation
on vague subjects, he would say: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, connaissez
vous le dernier potin du 'Palace'? Il est Ã©patant,
je vous assure.</i>" The effect was certain. Immediately
seized by curiosity, tickled in her latent snobbishness,
wishing to know all the little mysteries of Olympus&mdash;the
"Palace"&mdash;the lady from the Grand Hotel, the
"Schweizerhof," the HÃ´tel du Lac, the "Victoria,"
would turn her beautiful eyes to Giorgio Galanti, which
told him that not only were they questioning him, but
were promising him the reward of indiscretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the tittle-tattle&mdash;first, second, and third class&mdash;of
every day of the extremely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i> society of the "Palace"
was sometimes vulgar or frankly cruel in substance, it
was always light, witty, graceful, and diverting in form.
The most terrible things, true or fairly true, were said
with such a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">brio</i>, such ingenuousness, and often with such
profound humour, that not only did they cause no horror,
but they even caused the whitest and tenderest souls to
smile. The ineffable, invincible, inimitable French language
lent itself for this purpose, that language in which
everything is rounded, garlanded, and shines. It is true
that Paul Fry, the Bohemian, was a player of extraordinary
strength and fortune at every game, who always
tried to play with millionaires and millionairesses; but
the great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potin</i>, with which Giorgio Galanti attracted the
most Catholic and snobbish Spaniard, Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s
de Fuentes, was when Fry, bold and cool, began to play
with Signora Azquierda, an immensely rich Argentinian,
who lived at Paris, and having tried conclusions with her,
she won from him three thousand francs at poker&mdash;she,
the woman, from him, Paul Fry, the invincible! Was
not this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potin</i> told attractively, delicious in its perversity?
Then there was another scandal, that about
Lady Hermione Crozes, the Englishwoman divorced
from Lord Crozes, tall, thin, ruddy of countenance, with
dazzling eyes, who disappeared directly after lunch and
dinner, and whom everyone believed to have shut herself
up in her room to receive a lover, till at last it was
discovered that she went to drink all alone twice a day,
consuming the most terrible mixtures, and her maids
had to help her in her furies, or take care of her like a
baby in her torpors that seemed like death. Said with
good grace, did not this atrocious happening lose all its
atrocity? Another scandal which lasted more than a
day, a most important one, concerned Frau van der
Claes, a Hamburg lady, who had a poor lover and a son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of twenty, both of whom had cost her much money, and
how one day Frau van der Claes, when Lina Cavalieri
had arrived at the HÃ´tel du Lac, had seen her son, which
did not matter, and her lover, which was a serious business,
fall head over ears in love with the beautiful Italian
singer, and her mad anger and the money she squandered
on her son to make him a rival to her lover so that he
might miss the goal and return to her, and the useless
courting of the Cavalieri by son and lover&mdash;this intensely
complicated scandal, how well it circulated, how sketchy
in its disgusting particulars, how graceful in its brutal
circumstances!</p>

<p>About Annie Clarke and her daughter Mabel, during
their sojourn there of three weeks, there had been at
least ten large scandals and twenty little ones. Their
milliard, their eight hundred, or hundred, or hundred and
fifty, or fifty, or thirty millions had formed an accidental
variation to the scandals, and the birth and life of the
very placid Mrs. Annie Clarke, so like a dumb and patient
idol, had been time after time related in bizarre terms,
telling how she had been an opera singer, or a nurse, or
the daughter of a shepherd in the Far West, or an Italian
foundling, and finally the widow of another millionaire,
whom Mr. Clarke, on losing his wife, had ruined and
forced to commit suicide.</p>

<p>And what an amount of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i>, inside and outside the
hotel, about the excellent Mr. Clarke, who remained on
the other side of the ocean, in his palace on Fifth Avenue,
and every two days sent a cablegram to his ladies, to tell
them he was well and that all was well, and every two
days received a very short telegram in reply&mdash;which
simplified correspondence. What <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i> of the first order
about Mr. Clarke, who was declared to be enormously
rich or stupidly poor, an undeserving thief or a philanthropist,
a king of rubber, an emperor of gutta-percha,
a father eternal of aluminium for cooking utensils! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i> every evening about the solitary jewel of the
day of Mrs. Clarke&mdash;the pearl collar, the emerald pin,
the ruby ring, the diadem of diamonds; and all of them
enormous, colossal&mdash;pearls, emeralds, ruby, sapphire,
diamond. What <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i> these were, and the principal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potin</i> of all that these jewels, too unique, too enormous,
too colossal, were perfectly imitated from the real, that
they were false: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, ma chÃ¨re, du toc, pas autre chose;
du toc splendide, mais du toc!</i>" And about Mabel Clarke,&mdash;so
beautiful, so full of every grace, so amiable, so frank,
the image and symbol of a race vibrant with youth, the
image and symbol of a new femininity, different and
differently graced and attractive&mdash;what a daily exercise
of scandalmongers, whom her simplicity and loyalty did
not succeed in disarming, created especially by mothers
blessed with daughters; and how her virtue and her
dowry suffered tremendous oscillations from one day to
another. She was very rich, richer than Anna Gould or
Gladys Vanderbilt; she was poorest of the poor; she
had refused the Duke of Sairmeuse, because she wished
to be a Serene Highness; she had had an intrigue with a
tenor of the Manhattan theatre; she had been engaged
to a son of a king of tinned goods; she was a cold flirt;
she adored Italy, and would have married even a dandy
of Lucca; she had been converted to Catholicism; she
was making a fool of Vittorio Lante; she loved him. All
this kept increasing towards the decline of the season,
the more so as all the other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potins</i> had been consumed
and some were threadbare; the more so as the now open
love of Vittorio and Mabel exasperated so many people&mdash;hunters
after dowries for silent, sad daughters who
never found a husband, mothers of eligible young men&mdash;all
were annoyed at another's fortune, another's love,
another's happiness. On the evening of the great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon
de bienfaisance</i> at the Palace Hotel, with tickets at
twenty francs, the night of the 25th of August, the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
great ball at the "Palace," the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i> night of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i> nights,
the love-making, engagement, and marriage of Mabel
Clarke and Vittorio Lante, the no love, no engagement,
the no marriage, were the greatest and most multiform
source of gossip of the day, evening, and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

</div>


<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>Unfailingly every lady who entered, in all the splendour
of her ball dress, stopped a moment at the threshold
of the hall of the Palace Hotel, to give a glance at
the hall, which is divided into two or three parts,
curiously divided and united, where the fortunate inhabitants
of this Olympus of the Engadine were standing,
sitting, or walking about in pairs or groups. And
by the lady's rapid and indicative glance, which embraced
the spectacle, she was at once recognised as
initiated or profane. The initiated was the lady of other
hotels of the Bad or Dorf who, by her rank and habits,
was constantly in touch with the Olympus of the
"Palace," who often came there to dinner and took part
in all the balls; she was the great lady living in a sumptuous
private villa with her family, retinue, and carriages,
and hence she was not only initiated, but was a
goddess of an Olympus more Olympian than the
"Palace," if it is possible to imagine it. The initiated
halted a moment to look, at the threshold of the hall,
merely to search with her eye for an especial friend; and
she, if there, would come towards her with a rustling of
silk, with a shining of sequins and diamonds, and would
take the initiated away with her to a corner at the back
to chat, as they waited for the ball.</p>

<p>But in the glance of the profane, at the threshold of
the sacred vestibule, which they had seldom crossed in
the daytime or never, and who were certainly crossing it
for the first time at night, everything was to be seen:
uncertainty, curiosity, vanity, humility, embarrassment,
fastidiousness, and perhaps even a slight feeling of pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
The more vainly audacious of the profane adored and
hated the "Palace" from afar, and they were dying to
go there to mix with those Olympian surroundings, yet
none of them ever succeeded in being invited there; so
they pretended not to mind and spoke badly of the
"Palace," though they would have walked on their
knees to enter and remain there on one or all of the guest
nights. Other profane were anxious to gain an intimate
knowledge of an atmosphere famous for its refined luxury,
for its exquisite pleasures, for a sense of exclusiveness,
and secretly tormented by curiosity and desires beyond
their station, had eagerly waited the chance of living
there for one evening only, even as intruders. Some
other profane living at St. Moritz apart from great festivities,
meetings, and amusements, wishing for one
night to show the rich dress they had never put on, and
the hair tiring they had never tried, wishing for one
evening not to be bored, had firmly believed in satisfying
this complex desire of theirs by passing an enchanting
evening at the "Palace." And since for twenty
francs one could reach this lofty, closed Olympus, since
for only twenty francs one could enter this terrestrial
paradise, all the profane&mdash;the vain, the covetous, the
dreamers, the curious, the bored&mdash;had been preparing
themselves for a week for this supreme approach, had
been agitated about their dress, their hair tire, their
cloak, their carriage, and their escort. In appearance
they were happily agitated, but secretly they were preoccupied
about cutting a poor figure in some way, and
they pretended ease, distraction, simplicity, as if from
time immemorial they had been frequenters of the
"Palace." But the moment they penetrated the first
vestibule of the temple dedicated to the god "Snob," in
that temple which seemed to bear written, in its shining
lights, in the superb wealth spread around, in the powerful
luxury of its atmosphere and its people, the prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and violent motto of an ardent and feverish society:
"E<small>VVIVA LA</small> V<small>ITA</small>!"</p>

<p>When these profane, these intruders, entered there, all
their emotion, all their fervour, in the long glance,
changed into doubt, regret, and pain, and they would
almost have turned back, as if they felt themselves profane,
more than ever and eternally profane. However,
hesitation, contrition, and pain were but for a moment:
with the deep, civil courage of which women give a hundred
proofs every day, of which no one is aware, though
often it reaches to heroism; with an act of resolution
and valour, with feigned indifference and ingenuousness,
the profane entered and advanced, as if they were
initiated. No one came forward to meet them; they
knew not where to direct themselves, whether to right
or left or to the rear; but followed resolutely by their
husbands and brothers, they went and sat down in some
place, fanning themselves or playing with their shawls,
tranquil in appearance, as if they were of the house, as
if they had lived for years at the "Palace."</p>

<p>Soon the profane were in every corner; and if their
number increased, their worldly condition at that festival
was not bettered. No one knew them there, they
knew no one&mdash;they remained isolated. After chatting
a little with a husband or brother or son who accompanied
them, appearing to smile and joke, to be interested
and amused, they became silent and discouraged.
They watched with badly concealed anxiety the elegant
crowd that surrounded them, that was seated or grouped
together or divided, as it greeted each other or chatted
livelily; the poor profane watched to discover a face
they knew of man or woman, to exchange, if not a
word, a greeting, a smile, a nod with a human being of
that crowd, and, disconsolate, finding none, they lowered
their eyes upon the figures of their Louis XVI fans. Still
more deeply irritated were the profane who by chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
knew someone at the "Palace." The loud, presumptuous,
very wealthy Frau Mentzel came from the Stahlbad,
and as she held a privileged court there, she had
succeeded sometimes, merely by chance, in having at
her luncheons, her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goÃ»ters</i>, and her dinners some gentleman
of the "Palace" itself, or some initiated of the
"Badrutt," of the Grand Hotel, the ChÃ¢teau, the villas,
on days in which one of these gentlemen had absolutely
nothing better to do; this Frau Mentzel was absolutely
scandalised because among the three or four of those she
knew one had greeted her, saying two words, and had
turned on his heels; another had merely bowed to her
without speaking; another had not seen her; and the
last had openly pretended not to have seen her. Covered
with jewels, in a sumptuous Parisian toilette, with an
enormous feather in her hair, she did nothing but grind
her teeth, chewing curses against the four <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lÃ¢cheurs</i>, while
her husband and her two <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cavalieri serventi</i>, two colourless
and humble parasites, listened terrified and silent,
as they bowed their heads servilely.</p>

<p>As for Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s de Fuentes, profane of the
profane, who looked very beautiful in a white satin dress
trimmed with silver, who was always beautiful, in spite
of too much rouge, bistre, and pearl powder, with which
she spoiled her brown, Spanish face, she had seen three
or four faces pass before her; and among them her
Italian friend, Don Giorgio Galanti. Every time the
perfidious Italian gave his arm to a different lady and
only once had he directed at Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s a greeting
and a distinctly cold smile. And she had hoped to be led
round in triumph by him through the <em>salons</em> of the
"Palace"; she had dared to hope to dance the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i>
with him. Deluded and deeply snubbed, she had not
even the strength to quarrel in Spanish with her poor
husband; her beautiful black eyes, which were too
much underlined with bistre, filled with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>As if they wished to show even more markedly the
distance that separated them from the profane, matrons
and maids and gentlemen of all ages treated each other
with such domesticity, with such familiarity, that they
seemed to be the closest relations, the most intimate and
inseparable friends. The women particularly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tutoied</i>
each other; many men and women called each other by
name. French diminutives and English endearments
were to be heard and strange nicknames. One greeted
Fanchette, another excused the absence of Bob, one
gave news of Dorine, another asked after Gladys or spoke
of Bibi's illness. In that society it seemed as if no one
any longer had a surname or title; all seemed brothers,
cousins, husbands, lovers of one race and caste, of a
single country and house. Whatever did the wretched,
profane intruders know about those names, endearments,
and nicknames, whoever they were, wherever they came
from, whatever they did; if Bibi were a man or woman,
or if Gladys were young or old? However could the
profane intruders understand those conversations in
French, English, or German, conversations which seemed
to be carried on in a special and incomprehensible, aristocratic
jargon, full of sub-understandings, references to
people unknown to them, allusions to events they knew
nothing of; however could they understand that chaff
full of completely conventional wit, whose formula
escaped them? What could they see in the malicious
smiles, in the little sceptical bursts of laughter? What
could they grasp of the subdued, half-uttered phrases
said with a sneer&mdash;a regular cryptic language, let us
say? How could they imagine from a word thrown into
the ear an assignment, a refusal, a consent, a warning, a
malignity, a trouble, a scandal especially; words underlined
by a fleeting but expressive glance, by a rapid but
suggestive squeeze of the hand? Ought not the profane
intruders to be astonished, stupefied, almost oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
by all this, while the curious, alluring spectacle was
augmenting their wonderment and secret pain?</p>

<p>A curious, most curious, yet alluring spectacle! Not
one of the ladies of the "Palace" or of the initiated
resembled each other; not one was dressed alike; there
was not one whose jewels resembled another's; not one
whose beauty was equal to another's; not one whose
ugliness was similar to another's ugliness. All were
truly Olympian, by an almost mysterious sign that made
them seem of one race and caste, of but one country and
family. But beyond this indefinite sign, each preserved
a personal character in face, dress, features, and gestures.
And all these women seemed to be detached from a background
even more phantasmagorial, of exquisite French women,
who caused the flowing lines of their Parisian
dresses to undulate gently from their hips, amidst light
lace and soft silk, purposely brought from the great
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ateliers</i> of the Rue de la Paix for balls at the "Palace"&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le
Palace, ma chÃ¨re, vous pensez</i>&mdash;detached from a background
of Austrian ladies, with rich and graceful dresses,
certainly beautiful, but rather more pleasing than beautiful;
separated by a background of Egyptians, Greeks,
Roumanians, Argentines, Spaniards, who owed it to
their immense fortunes, their natural, humble sweetness
of temperament, that they were enabled to be introduced
and placed in the Olympus of the "Palace";
detached from a background of Italian women, majestic
and grave, or pretty and witty&mdash;each figure, amidst
those more prominent and those more in the shade, with
her own character and own life forming a curious, singular,
and alluring spectacle. The profane intruders,
with dazzled eyes and bewildered glance, went from one
to another of these feminine figures and now and then,
tired of wondering, they lowered their glance, a little
pale, before a world of such varied appearances, multiform
and dissimilar, a world from which every moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they felt themselves separated for ever: they raised
their eyes, ever less anxiously, ever more fatigued, for
some new, wondrous apparition.</p>

<p>At last, amidst the murmurs of the whole crowd, appeared,
late as usual, the famous Miss Miriam Jenkyns,
a divine girl&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ah, elle est vraiment divine, ma chÃ¨re</i>&mdash;with
whom already ten to thirty celebrated personages were
in love, and numerous unknown personages. Amongst
the illustrious were an hereditary prince of a powerful
empire, an Indian Maharajah, a grandee of Spain, a celebrated
scientist, a renowned painter and father of sons;
but Miss Jenkyns loved none of them, and instead, contented
herself with her unrestrained desire of conquest,
being now a Europeanised American girl, full of the
deepest scepticism. Nevertheless, as she came from
Pontresina she appeared one of the last, desired and invoked
especially by those who had never seen her. She
appeared in a wilful simplicity, dressed in a tunic of
white wool, like the "Primavera" of Sandro Botticelli,
adorned with a branch of flowers which crossed the skirt
right to its hem, with hair knotted a little loosely as in
the picture of the great Tuscan, and covered with loose
flowers, with a white tulle shawl, like a cloud, on her
shoulders and arms. Her natural beauty had been recomposed
and transformed by her according to the
purest pre-Raphaelite type, and it was very difficult to
discover the subtle and minute art of the recomposition
and transformation. There was another great murmuring,
one of the last, when the Princess of Leiningen
entered, an Armenian who, in the strangest circumstances,
had married a German mediatised prince, a
military prince, whose appearances were rare. Not
very tall of stature, in fact rather small, but moulded
to perfection, with little hands and feet, the Princess
of Leiningen comprised within herself the poetic
legends of Armenian beauty. Beneath a mass of black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
shining hair, her forehead was white and short, her
two immense black eyes were shining like jewels; she
had a pure, oval face, very white, on which the long
eyelashes cast a slight shadow, touched up by the inevitable
but pretty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillage</i> of Eastern women, with rather
a crimson rouge on the cheeks and the lobes of the ears,
a slightly violet shade beneath the eyes, some black, the
better to arch the subtle eyebrows, and a little of the
rather crimson rouge on the lips. She was dressed completely
in black, and since she was so white she seemed
to rise from a background of shadow; an immense hat
of black tulle strangely framed her white face and splendid
eyes. She always wore an immense hat, black or
white, even with her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©colletÃ©</i> dresses, and she never
danced. She crossed the room with her light little feet,
shod in white satin, without looking at anyone&mdash;a dream
creature, unreal as one of Edgar Allan Poe's characters,
unreal as a vision in an hallucination. She remained at
the back of the <em>salon</em> silent beneath the shadow of her
black hat and black dress, completely white with her
unreal countenance.</p>

<p>At this last strange appearance the profane felt their
impressions to be founded and they settled themselves
into two different parties. The one, proud and impertinent,
like Frau Mentzel, openly hated the surroundings
they had wished to penetrate and began to vent their
anger and their humiliation, finding all the matrons and
maids of the "Palace," who were unaware of their existence,
ugly, awkward, indecent, shameless, venting their
anger on their husbands and followers who, poor people,
through cowardice agreed, though they were frightened
at heart lest these vituperations should be heard, as they
looked around them carefully in fear of a scandal. The
other party, true snobs, blind and deaf adorers of that
surrounding, venerated it even more deeply, felt themselves
even more humiliated, and oppressed, bewailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
even more their own anonymity, nullity, and lack of
existence. They felt they deserved to be anonymous
there and non-existing for ever: they understood that
they had no right, that they never would have any right
to belong to that superior, unarrivable, sublime humanity
that lived at the "Palace"!</p>

<p>The which superior, unreachable, sublime humanity,
while it aroused such vain disdain, such empty proposals
of revenge, such sterile lamentation among the wretched
profane, was troubling itself with nothing else at that
lively and intense hour of the ball but with that deep
and supreme feminine interest&mdash;to see, observe, study,
value, and put a figure on the jewels of the other women
in the ballroom. To note, analyse, and value these
jewels and compare them with their own; at times to
smile in triumph, or enviously, or really bitterly, according
as their own jewels succeeded in being superior, equal,
inferior, or very inferior to the others. Their eyes seemed
not to rest on the pearl necklaces, on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riviÃ¨res</i> of
diamonds, the diadems of pearls and diamonds, the
emerald solitaires, and the ruby sprays. Their glance
was fleeting, their lips offered other words, but the women
did nothing but mentally make rapid calculations, after
which they smiled carelessly, or suddenly sighed, or were
unexpectedly disturbed. For on that summer night in
the high mountains, in a landscape of the purest beauty,
amid proud peaks so close to the stars, amid eternal
glaciers that told an austere and terrible tale, in that
room there were collected, in the shape of jewels, the
fortune perhaps of a populace. At the splendour of
thousands and thousands of gems, at the scintillations of
those thousands of precious stones, in the presence of all
that bewildering brilliance, women's beauty, girls' grace,
and richness of apparel were concentrated into a furnace
of light, lost their value, and were completely eclipsed.
Each woman's hair, neck, bosom, and arms were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thickly crowded with pearls and diamonds, sapphires
and emeralds, while the jewels of some were few, but
enormous, that nothing took the eye or mind, at once
astonishing and frightening, but that mad, frenzied
luxury up there in the high mountains, in the still
summer night, not far from the whiteness of the peaks
profiled against the sky. But suddenly even that madness
and frenzy seemed conquered, and in spite of the
studied reserve of all those women, and in spite of the
studied indifference of the men, a word passed from
group to group, from room to room, murmured a hundred
times, softly or loudly:</p>

<p>"The tiara! The tiara!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Annie Clarke appeared in the hall, coming from
her apartments, although her daughter had been dancing
for an hour, having for her partner in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i> Don
Vittorio Lante della Scala. Being lazy, Annie Clarke
always arrived late, or perhaps she did so purposely.
That evening she was wearing a rather dark dress of
purple velvet, trimmed with quite simple lace; from
neck and bosom descended a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riviÃ¨re</i> of diamonds, which
were very large at the neck, and afterwards became less
large, in long streams of small, shining diamonds, like
streams of running water, falling to the waist, whence
neck, bosom, and corsage assumed a luminous, strange
appearance. But what was astounding in Annie Clarke
that evening, what had never been seen before, was her
diamond tiara. It was not a single diadem of large
diamonds, but three diadems, one above the other, in
flowers, and leaves, and Arabic work and points. It was
a veritable little tower of diamonds, perched on a suitable
coiffure. It was a tiara that bizarrely resembled those of
the High Priests of Buddha in Indian temples, a tiara
that strangely resembled the jewelled triple crown of
the Pope of the whole Catholic world. It was the tiara
of all the great American ladies, the famous tiara of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
house of Clarke, like a lighthouse or like the torch which
Bartholdi's "Liberty" holds aloft over the port of
Brooklyn, to show navigators the entrance to New York.
As Annie Clarke crossed the length of the hall quietly
and indifferently to pay her respects to Her Serene Highness,
the Grand Duchess of Salm-Salm, this Clarke tiara,
beacon and torch of America, eclipsed, annulled, destroyed&mdash;a
unique, inimitable jewel&mdash;all the other jewels
of the women who were gathered there. After a great
silence of wonderment amongst the throng, of groups
near and far, after a silence of stupor, spite, annoyance,
envy, anger, and sadness; after some instants of these
atrocious, seething sentiments of every kind, a chattering
began and spread everywhere about the tiara and
against it, about Mabel's marriage and against it.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Puis-je me congratuler pour les fianÃ§ailles de votre
chÃ¨re fille?</i>" the Grand Duchess politely asked Annie
Clarke.</p>

<p>As she bowed, the tiara threw a stream of light around.
Beneath her tiara Annie Clarke smiled, bowed, and expressed
her thanks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the hundred and twenty ladies who were present
at the "Palace" festivities that evening but eighty,
perhaps, were seated round the ballroom for the charity
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i>; and among the eighty only thirty were dancing.
Thus even in this that reputation for theatricalism and
parade, which everything assumed in the "Palace"
Olympus, was maintained: that reputation was maintained,
so that there was always a spectacle and a public
which at times changed sides, passing from the stage to
the stalls, and vice versa. There were not many couples,
then, to dance in the long and undulating whirls of the
"Boston," in the rapid if rarer twirls of the waltz&mdash;so
much the fashion now the "Boston," so out of fashion
the waltz! There were not many couples, hence those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
who danced had plenty of room in which to turn round,
now languidly, now more resolutely, in the difficult
modern art of the "Boston." There was no bumping
of each other; trains gyrated in their silken softness
without being trod upon; voile and tulle skirts seemed
like revolving clouds. Thus the dancers could display
all their mastery of the dance if they possessed it, and
those who did not possess it dared not expose themselves
on the stage, since all around the curious, attentive
public followed such a dance spectacle as if they were
at the theatre; observing, criticising, approving, and
scoffing. On that stage there were some of the dancers
of the first flight: the slender Principessa di Castelforte
in her white dress and with her string of pearls, worth
half a million; another Italian, the Marchesa di Althan,
a reed of a woman with an attractive, ugly face; Signorina
de Aguilar, a Brazilian, dressed in red, with a
vigour quite Spanish, dancing like a lost soul, like an
insatiable flame. Madame Lawrence danced like a
Grecian bas-relief; Miss Mabel Clarke with perfect harmony,
in the grace and ardour of the dance; Miss
Miriam Jenkyns glided as if she were a shadow or a
nymph on the meadows. And there were other celebrated
dancers, celebrated in all cosmopolitan <em>salons</em>, at
Biarritz, at Nice, and at Cairo.</p>

<p>In the first flight among the men were Count Buchner,
the diplomat, who had danced in all the capitals of the
world for thirty years on end, and at sixty, dried and
withered as he was, was still a beautiful dancer; the
beau of beaux, the Hungarian, the Comte de Hencke, the
famous dancer of the <em>majourka</em> to the music of Liszt;
Don Vittorio Lante della Scala, one of the most graceful
and vigorous dancers of Italy; the young Comte de Roy,
the little Frenchman; Edward Crozes, the twenty-year-old
son of Lady Crozes. People came and went from the
hall, the saloon, and other rooms, and the audience at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
performance changed and was renewed around the
famous dancers. The performance continued, each performing
his or her part with artistic zeal, amidst the
approval or adverse criticisms of the audience. In a
dress of tenderest pink <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crÃªpe</i>, surrounded by a silver
girdle, with a small wreath of little roses around her
riotous chestnut hair, Mabel Clarke, one of the chief
characters of this worldly comedy, was dancing the beginning
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i> with another of the chief dancer-actors,
Vittorio Lante della Scala; but seized by the
truth and the force of their feelings, they forgot to be
actors. They had no thought of pleasing others, of being
admired by others. They forgot altogether their surroundings,
with their artifices and pretences and obligatory
masks; and only the perfect, tranquil joy of being
together held them in its beautiful frankness, of not
leaving each other, of being able to let themselves go to
the rhythm of the music in harmonious turns, where they
seemed to depart and vanish afar in a dream of well-being
led on by the languid murmur of the music. In
their sentimental absorption they seemed even more to
suit each other, and the public of the boxes and stalls
around them wondered at them, then with a sneer the
fashionable gossiping, calumny, and back-biting began
again, subduedly.</p>

<p>"... Lante has hit it off."</p>

<p>"... The girl has lost her head."</p>

<p>"... Of course, he has done his best to compromise
her."</p>

<p>"... In any case, he won't be the first."</p>

<p>"... St. Moritz is a great marriage mart."</p>

<p>"... There are plenty of men, too."</p>

<p>Every now and then the music was silent, and the
dancers promenaded arm in arm or sat down for a
moment, the girls with their hands full of flowers and
their figures crossed with ribbons of brilliant colours, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i> gifts. Then matron and maid would approach
Mabel and Vittorio with a smile of satisfaction on their
lips, asking in French, in English, in German:</p>

<p>"May I congratulate you?"</p>

<p>The American girl's beautiful head, crowned with
roses, said "yes" with a gracious, frank bow. Vittorio
Lante, unable to control himself, for a moment paled
with joy, and twisted his yellow moustaches nervously.
The friend would be profuse in her compliments.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, chÃ¨re, merci</i>," exclaimed Mabel Clarke
frankly, in her limpid voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" scarcely murmured Vittorio Lante.</p>

<p>Once alone, they looked at each other, enjoying those
delicious moments intensely. Then, without speaking,
in simultaneous action, they joined in the dance again,
between the Countess of Durckeim, the Hungarian, a
charming eccentric, and Beau de Hencke, who astonished
the room, or they danced between the Comte de Roy and
Miriam Jenkyns, who danced as if in one of Corot's
pictures. Then the friend, maid or matron would rejoin
her own set. With spiteful glances, correctly veiled,
with slighting words and unfinished phrase, the chorus
about Mabel Clarke began again:</p>

<p>"... Oh, these American girls, all the world is theirs.
It is disgusting."</p>

<p>"... These American girls pretend to be strong, and
as soon as they see an Italian's moustaches they fall."</p>

<p>"... These American girls; their dowry is always a
story, a fable, a romance."</p>

<p>"... Dowry? A settlement, and uncertain, too."</p>

<p>"... Papa Clarke may go under."</p>

<p>"... He has gone under three times."</p>

<p>"... Mabel's dear papa is a faker of pig's flesh."</p>

<p>"... The mother is silly and vain. Poor Vittorio,
what a father and mother-in-law!"</p>

<p>In a dance that became ever more lively, the first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
second parts of that theatrical spectacle passed&mdash;the
"Palace" <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i>. A more precipitous movement led
the couples amidst gauze, tulle, ribbons, paper caps,
streamers of fresh flowers, and Swiss bells of silver paper.</p>

<p>Now and then, during a moment's pause, a friend
stopped beside Mabel and Vittorio, formulated a courteous
inquiry, bowed at the reply, and offered his congratulations,
seemingly complimentary and full of
worldly good-nature. The orchestra gave forth its fervid
recall; the couples danced anew in a hurried whirl. The
friend would withdraw to form the centre of a group of
men, old, middle-aged, and young, to whom he brought
the news, and where the worldly, masculine choir, with
disingenuous air, with an air as if it did not matter,
occupied itself particularly with Vittorio Lante.</p>

<p>"... He hasn't a farthing."</p>

<p>"... Seven hundred thousand francs' worth of
debts."</p>

<p>"... Refused five times by five girls."</p>

<p>"... His mother mends silk stockings to get a
living."</p>

<p>"... He can't pay his hotel bill."</p>

<p>"... Oh, now his creditors will wait."</p>

<p>"... Is it true that he paid his attentions to the
mother?"</p>

<p>"... He hasn't a title. The real princes are the
others, the Della Rovere."</p>

<p>"... He can buy it back; it is there in the family.
He has only to pay well for it."</p>

<p>"... He can do that now."</p>

<p>"... It seems that the girl has already given him
money. It is the custom in America."</p>

<p>More gaily, naturally, and simply towards its close, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i> gathered together all the couples in the room. By
now all the actors had forgotten parade and performance,
and were merely abandoning themselves to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and intoxicating pleasure of living. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i> ended,
because all wished to go to supper, to the extremely
dainty, exquisite supper which, in an extremely new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>
aspect, closes every special night at the "Palace." In
two or three rooms the tables were ready. The company
was chosen carefully, sympathetic and antipathetic were
again carefully expressed, with bizarre reunions and
cruel exclusions. In the ballroom the final picture still
kept the crowd. Upon two little chariots, drawn by
hand, appeared two great piles of green branches and
wild flowers, tied with ribbons. Drawn joyfully into the
middle of the room, the bundles were opened, revealing
in the one Miriam Jenkyns, in the other Mabel Clarke,
the two leaders of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cotillon</i>. The greatest applause
greeted this final picture, and while the pair led the final
gallop, there were still some discreet exclamations
directed at Mabel and Vittorio:</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive les fiancÃ©s!</i>"</p>

<p>Blushing in her pink dress as she left the room on
Vittorio Lante's arm, Mabel Clarke passed into the hall,
to look for her mother to sup at the great Clarke table.
And now everyone surrounded her, to congratulate her
and Vittorio, and both, happy and composed, returned
thanks. A few moments afterwards all were seated at
table. At a table for men only, amidst young and old,
all more or less dowry-hunters, their less happy and less
fortunate chief, the Vicomte de Lynen, was telling in a
low voice, between the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">langouste Ã  la Colbert</i> and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaufroid de gibier</i>, how three years ago Vittorio Lante
had seduced a poor cousin of his house, how she had had
a baby by him, how he had deserted mother and little
daughter, and how the mother had threatened to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vitrioler l'AmÃ©ricaine</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Again, on the 23rd of August, the whole Engadine was
encompassed and surrounded by rain, not one of those
rough, short showers of the high mountains, which pass
from valley to valley like a seething whirlwind, and
leave the sky cleansed and serene where they have
passed, while the sky they overtake becomes cloudy and
obscured; but it was a soft, close, continuous, almost
tireless rain. The rain fell upon the ground indefatigably,
and impregnated it with profound damp and
pungent freshness; it fell on the waters of the lake,
from the great lake of Sils to the melancholy little lake
of Statz, imprinting on them thousands of little circles,
thousands of little ripples; it fell upon the leaves of the
trees, the meadow grass, the last flowers of the Alpine
summer, and leaves and grass became lucid with a new
and intense green, and the flowers became brighter. It
fell on roofs and verandahs, on villages and countryside,
and cleaned and clothed them with a bright mist, renovating
the air and ever purifying it. At windows and
balconies, at the glass doors of the hotel vestibules, on
that rainy morning there waited for some time all those
who in the Engadine go out every morning, sooner or
later, many longing for the fresh, free air, many for
amusements and diversion, while others were sighing for
the usual meetings, of accident or design, for adventures
begun or about to begin. Each as he watched the sky
and the horizon waited for the rain to tire, diminish, and
cease; but the rain seemed even more regular and tranquil,
as it fell methodically and monotonously in an
immense veil of light grey that held the whole Engadine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Then men, women, and children who were unwilling to
renounce the open air, their distractions and meetings,
gradually vanished from window, balcony, and the glass
doors of vestibules, and by degrees the roads of St.
Moritz Bad, which had been deserted for one or two
hours, began to be filled with people sallying forth from
the hotels, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©pendances</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensions</i>, and villas, who descended
on tram and foot from St. Moritz Dorf to the
Bad in search of life, movement, and people. But beneath
the fine downpour, and through the continuous
silvery drops, people were of another colour and assumed
other lines. All the white dresses of the women were
changed to black, dark grey, and blue, and all the white,
transparent blouses had vanished, or were hidden beneath
woollen jackets, closely buttoned at the bosom,
with collars raised; and skirts were shorter than ever,
showing the feet to the calf, shod in strong boots with
short nails. In place of white, blue, or pink veils, that
formed a cloud round hats and faces, were substituted
dark veils which surrounded hat and face tightly. All
the variegated summer suits of the men had vanished,
with straw and panama hats, and all were dressed
gloomily in black overcoats; the Germans especially had
drawn on their ulsters, cut as it were with an axe, like
the side of a chest of drawers, with a belt behind held
fast by a huge button. But beneath the incessant rain
all seemed another people, with other faces and bodies,
with other gestures and movements. All went with
rapid steps, without stopping, along the beautiful clear
roads of the Bad, amidst the gardens full of trees and the
public park, only slowing their steps beneath the famous
porticoes of the Bad. Nearly all came and went to and
from the great wooden <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</i>, where is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Serpentquelle</i>,
a new spring, to and from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galÃ©rie de bois</i>, which
is the meeting-place of meeting-places when it does not
rain&mdash;but there is no promenading when it rains&mdash;while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in the background the orchestra plays the more passionate
airs from <em>Carmen</em>, and the more penetrating from
<em>Manon</em>, and on the other side the ladies pretend to drink
the waters while they walk up and down and flirt. That
morning the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">promenoir</i> is all humid with the rain, and
there is a light vapour and steam in the air; but the
meetings, the distractions, adventures even, beneath the
rain, developed themselves, while the notes of <em>AÃ¯da</em>
caused Italian hearts to beat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, as the rain continued, a different
way of using the time was organised. In the vestibule
of the HÃ´tel du Lac was hung a notice, on which was
written "<em>Kinderballet</em>," that is to say, a children's dance,
the celebrated, pretty dance for children which takes
place at that hotel on a wet day. At the "Stahlbad"
Frau Mentzel invited, through the telephone, fifty people
to tea, when in the <em>salon</em> there were already fifty people
belonging to the same hotel. At St. Moritz Dorf, at the
"Palace," twenty bridge tables were set, instead of the
usual eight; at the "Kulm" a billiard match was
started. Everywhere ping-pong tables were set up for
boys and girls, everywhere the reading-rooms overflowed
with people, and as an exception each took tea in his own
hotel. Towards six the rain began to diminish, at half-past
six it rained no more; so nearly all the men went
forth for a quarter of an hour or five minutes for a
breather, as they said, or to buy a paper and flowers. All
breathed a very fresh air, and he who tarried found it
very cold. At eight in the evening in all the hotels, as the
ladies came down to dinner in low dresses, the large fireplaces
had been lit; on entering their rooms at midnight
they found their fires lit, and the stoves roaring
with heat. The thermometer had descended rapidly to
one degree below zero. Next morning the whole Engadine
was covered with snow; it had snowed for five or
six hours during the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>As from his windows he watched the landscape become
white with a wintry aspect, but without any of the cruel
sadness of a winter day, with a slight whiteness in which
he perceived grass and earth, with a whiteness almost
ready to melt and vanish, Lucio Sabini moved impatiently.
He opened the windows to see better, and leant
out. He perceived that on the roads the snow had
already vanished, but that the woods and meadows were
still covered with it, and that the mountains around
were covered with snow right to their base.</p>

<p>"But the roads are free," he said to himself, striving
to conquer his impatience.</p>

<p>Impatience, uncertainty, and irritation disturbed him,
as he dressed rapidly, glancing now and then at his
watch. During the night he had slept little and badly,
owing to a dull restlessness which he attributed to the
idea of having to rise early that morning for the excursion
with Lilian Temple and Miss May Ford to the
Bernina Pass. He had slept little and badly, perhaps
because his heart, nerves, and senses were overflowing
with life, in a fullness that was sometimes too tumultuous,
which he strove in vain to repress and hide. In the
presence of the snow that had rendered white and cold
all the landscape of mountains and woods, of meadows
and houses, the fear lest that expected, desired, invoked
excursion, that excursion which was perhaps to be the
most beautiful and exalted of that month of love, could
no longer take place, suddenly conquered him and bore
him down, like a child who has had what he most desired
snatched away from him.</p>

<p>"They will not go," he said to himself, as he finished
dressing.</p>

<p>And the day that was a mistake and a failure oppressed
him with the weight of a mortal sadness. The carriage
which was to take them to the Bernina Pass ought
already to be in front of the "Kulm," according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
instructions he had given the driver. Already he should
have walked the short stretch from his "Caspar Badrutt"
to the "Kulm." But with all the snow on the mountains
and the woods and meadows perhaps even the
coachman had considered the excursion postponed.</p>

<p>"Postponed&mdash;till when? The month is ending,"
thought Lucio Sabini to himself bitterly.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning it was very silent at his hotel;
most of the early risers, perhaps, having seen the snow,
had remained in bed. He went into the long corridor,
where at the end was the telephone; he asked for and
obtained communication with the HÃ´tel Kulm, and
begged that they would ask if the Misses Temple and
Ford still decided to go to the Bernina. He waited at the
telephone, pale, with his eyes a little swollen from want
of sleep, chewing the end of a cigarette which had gone
out. Suddenly the "Kulm" telephone rang, and told
him that Miss Temple was at the telephone. He strove
to restrain himself, and said quietly from the telephone:</p>

<p>"Good day, Miss Temple; look at the snow."</p>

<p>"Very beautiful indeed," replied a fresh, sweet voice
from the telephone.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid? Are we still going to the
Bernina?" he exclaimed, with a trembling of the voice
which he could not conquer.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are still going," she replied, in a secure and
tranquil voice.</p>

<p>"Can I come, then?"</p>

<p>"Of course; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>He crossed the silent, deserted little streets of the Dorf
in a great hurry; the shops were scarcely opening their
doors; the window-panes were dim, and behind the
window cases the shutters were still barred. At the hotel
doors the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseurs</i>, in dark green uniform, were
beating their feet against the road. Not a soul was
going up or coming down; not a soul was on the square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
before the "Kulm"; but, faithful to orders, the coachman
was there with his carriage, only he was wrapped
up in a heavy cloak, and had placed rugs over his two
fat, strong horses, so that they should not catch cold
while he waited. Now and then the horses shook their
heads, causing all their bells to tinkle. The air was calm
and equable, but very cold. Lucio Sabini entered the
vestibule, and found himself in the large Egyptian hall,
where there was not a soul; after a moment he saw
Lilian Temple coming towards him. The dear girl was
dressed in a short dress of black cloth, with a short,
pleated skirt. She wore a close-fitting jacket of otter-skin,
buttoned up closely, brightened by a cravat of
white lace; she had on a little black hat, with a white
lace veil fitting closely over the rosy face and blond hair.
Like a boy of eighteen in love, Lucio Sabini found her
more beautiful than ever. On her arm she carried a
heavy cloak and a carriage-rug, which she placed on a
chair to give her hand to Lucio.</p>

<p>"The carriage is waiting," he murmured vaguely, in
the first moment of happy confusion which Lilian's
presence always caused him.</p>

<p>"I heard the bells," she murmured, equally confused,
showing her confusion more than he.</p>

<p>"It is very cold."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Of course it doesn't matter," he consented, speaking
as if in a dream.</p>

<p>There was a silence between them: a silence full of
things.</p>

<p>"Isn't Miss Ford ready yet?" he asked, to break the
silence.</p>

<p>"She isn't coming to the Bernina," replied Lilian simply.</p>

<p>"Not coming?" asked Lucio, startled and disturbed.</p>

<p>"She is no longer so young. She suffers from rheumatism,
and it is very cold," said Lilian sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he experienced a moment of atrocious doubt,
and was atrociously oppressed by the thought of the
excursion postponed, of the day missed.</p>

<p>"And are we to go alone?" he asked, hesitating, and
fearing the reply.</p>

<p>"We two are going alone," replied Lilian serenely.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him, a man over whom so many
intoxicating and terrible emotions had passed, to dominate
the pallor which disturbed his face, and the blush
that afterwards suffused it. He could say nothing for
the interior tumult of his being. She, still serene, added:</p>

<p>"Dear May wishes me to leave a note to tell her what
time we shall probably return. At what time shall we
return, Signor Sabini?"</p>

<p>"At six, I think; not before," he stammered.</p>

<p>"The whole day, then," replied the girl. She went to
a table and wrote a note on a leaf from her pocket-book,
enclosed it in an envelope, and gave it to a servant.
Then her periwinkle-blue eyes invited Lucio to follow
her to the stairs which descended to the vestibule; a
little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</i> came after them, carrying the wraps and
the rug. Agilely Lilian climbed up with a spring, Lucio
placed himself beside her, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</i> spread the rug
over their knees and settled the wraps. The coachman,
too, wrapped his feet and body in a covering as far as
his chest, and cracked his whip; the bells tinkled, the
carriage started along the silent road that crosses the
Dorf and inclines towards the wood on the hill of CharnadÃ¼ras,
and set off at a trot into the silent country, all
white with snow.</p>

<p>As a reaction to his immense emotion of a few moments
ago, Lucio Sabini was invaded by a wave of
cynicism. So this beautiful girl with whom he was in
love, and who was in love with him, was left in his power,
she was given to him for a whole day without hardly
anyone knowing where they had gone; alone for a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
day, scarcely being asked, and that by chance, the
hour of return, perhaps merely to fix the dinner-hour;
and Miss May Ford was doing this, Lilian Temple's only
guardian, she to whom her father had entrusted her as a
second mother. But were these Englishwomen, young
and old, stupid and fools, or corrupt? And did they
think him an idiot or a saint? Why was the girl entrusted
to him, to whom he had been making love for
three weeks? So that he should compromise her, perhaps,
and be forced to marry her? What a stupid joke
to play on an experienced man like him; there was not
a Miss Ford in the land of Albion, or any other land, who
could have managed him! And was Lilian Temple
unaware&mdash;an idiot, an accomplice? An accomplice?
Frowning and stern, he bit his lips beneath his moustaches.
The carriage crossed the great Valley of Samaden,
where the snow covered the Corvatsch and the Muotta
to their bases, and extended in white flutings over the
expanses of the meadows.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" Lilian suddenly asked, after
too long a silence.</p>

<p>At first she looked at him timidly, then more frankly.
And he saw in her face an expression he had never
noticed before.</p>

<p>"I am tired," he replied coldly.</p>

<p>"Tired?"</p>

<p>"I slept badly and little," he replied dully, frowning.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I can't tell you, Miss Temple," he concluded,
turning his head away to avoid her glance.</p>

<p>"Then," she said quietly, "this excursion must bore
you a lot."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed ambiguously.</p>

<p>"Let us turn back," she proposed, simply and
sincerely.</p>

<p>"Turn back? Turn back?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. We will go another day to the Bernina.
It is very far, and you are so tired."</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes and listened to every inflection
of her voice; but he discovered nothing but
naturalness, loyalty, and candour.</p>

<p>"Would you turn back, Miss Temple? Would you
give up the outing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, to let you rest to-day, and see you this
evening charming and happy."</p>

<p>"For me, Lilian?"</p>

<p>"For you, dear," she replied, with a tremble of affection.
All Lucio Sabini's heart broke in tenderness:
all the gall of cynicism, all the poison of corruption was
conquered and destroyed. She could not understand
how base had been his thoughts and how he repented of
having yielded to such base thoughts: Lilian could not
have understood one of those infamous ideas. She
noticed that he was bending over her to speak to her
in his Italian tongue which she only half understood,
which he adopted so spontaneously in moments of
abandonment and sentimental dedication.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Povero caro amor mio ... tanto caro.</i>"</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" she asked, a little
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Beautiful things, things of love," he replied, enchanted,
gazing at her.</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose them; say them in English, or
French. I don't understand everything in Italian," she
murmured with a gracious pout of disdain.</p>

<p>"Why don't you understand Italian, little Lilian?
You are wrong: you should understand."</p>

<p>"I am going to learn this Italian," she declared
promptly.</p>

<p>"When?" he asked, fascinated.</p>

<p>"In a little while, in the autumn, when I am in
England," she said decisively, in a low voice. Her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
gloved hand lay upon the rug: he took it and interlaced
her fingers softly in his own.</p>

<p>"The days are so long in autumn and winter in my
country," she said dreamily.</p>

<p>He was silent beneath her enchantment, as he pressed
her hand.</p>

<p>"I want to write to you for Christmas," she added,
her large blue eyes full of visions, "a nice little letter all
in Italian, dear."</p>

<p>"But first," he asked, enamoured and impatient,
"you will write me nice long letters in French or
English?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, always," she replied, with that
certainty which now and then smote him and disturbed
him, afterwards to conquer him.</p>

<p>In her certainty Lilian did not ask him if he would
always reply; as if it were unnecessary to ask anything
so certain and evident, as if words served not to declare
and promise a certainty.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," he resumed, with an emotion
that veiled each accent, "do you mean to say, that that
angel Lilian Temple is a little fond of Lucio Sabini, who
deserves it not?"</p>

<p>"I do mean to say so," she affirmed, simply and loyally.</p>

<p>Nor did Lilian Temple ask Lucio Sabini, in return, if
he loved her a little, as if she were unshaken in her conviction
that Lucio was fond of her; and to hear so once
again were unnecessary. Once again Lilian's high
loyalty, her deep faith, her absolute trust, which never
having lied could not suppose a lie, moved Lucio to his
depths. He felt himself, as in the most impassioned
moments of his love, another man, transformed and
remade, incapable of deceit, incapable of fraud; he felt
himself, like the girl, vibrating with sincerity and
worthy of the faith she had in him, since he was, as she
was, sustained by an immense certainty. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
tremulous became his sensibility, the more fluid his
tenderness, the more impetuous his need of offering his
all, of giving himself completely.</p>

<p>"I am yours," he said solemnly in English.</p>

<p>"I am yours," she replied simply.</p>

<p>"Everything is so white here," she said, "ever so
much whiter than down below."</p>

<p>She pointed with a vague gesture of the hand to the
districts they had left behind, to St. Moritz, Celerina,
Pontresina, where the snow of the night was already
disappearing, while on the Bernina road they were
traversing, rather slowly, ever climbing to the regular
pace of the horses and the feeble tinkling of the bells,
the night's snow still remained intact. The snow
covered in great tracts of whiteness the last solitary
meadows which hid the banks of rocks that the winter
avalanches had precipitated in the silent valleys; it
covered in tracts the first hills that ascended towards
the loftier mountains, and united on high the August
snow with the many ancient snows of so many winters
which the summer's sun had been unable to melt, and,
finally, last night's snow had placed a new splendour
over the glaciers. As Lilian and Lucio went on their
way in the grand Alpine solitude, the whiteness increased
around them; in the rarefied air the breath that
escaped from the horses' nostrils seemed a light smoke
which hovered about them.</p>

<p>"Oh, how everything becomes whiter," Lilian repeated,
conquered by the spectacle, "nothing is more
beautiful than all this whiteness."</p>

<p>"The snow resembles you rather," murmured Lucio,
looking at her and not at the landscape.</p>

<p>She shook her blond head, a shadow of a smile playing
on her lips.</p>

<p>"Snow is destroyed in the countries where men live,"
she added, "but it remains pure and intact on high."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like it, you are pure," he whispered, as he gazed
again at her, enamoured.</p>

<p>Now and then she flushed beneath the ardour of his
glance; the blood rushed to the roots of her blond
tresses, a tender smile played about the beautiful,
chaste mouth.</p>

<p>"They gave you such a beautiful name&mdash;Lilian," he
told her again, with ardent sweetness.</p>

<p>"Do you really like it?"</p>

<p>"How is it you were given such a beautiful name&mdash;Lilian&mdash;Lilian?"</p>

<p>"It is an ordinary name in my country, in England,"
she replied, speaking dreamily.</p>

<p>"It is the name of a flower."</p>

<p>"A great many names of flowers are used for children
in my country, in England&mdash;Rose, Daisy, Violet. My
mother was called Violet&mdash;Violet Temple."</p>

<p>"But your name, the lily, is the name of an Italian
flower&mdash;one of our flowers, dear."</p>

<p>"I know that," she added thoughtfully, "it is the
emblem of Florence, <em>your</em> Florence."</p>

<p>"If it is mine, it is also <em>your</em> Florence," he exclaimed,
enamoured.</p>

<p>"Is everything you love and prefer also mine, dear?"
she asked, fixing him with her large eyes, so blue and
loyal.</p>

<p>"Everything," he exclaimed, with a burning glance.</p>

<p>She paled, and the little hand that was in Lucio's
shook convulsively. A short, intense giddiness overwhelmed
them, and they looked at each other,
frightened and lost. The carriage still proceeded slowly;
it had skirted the whole of the glacier of Morteratsch,
afterwards leaving it on the right, still ascending
among the lofty, fearful peaks of the Tschierva, the
Bellavista, Crast' AgÃ¼zza, and lording it in their midst
in an indescribable purity, was the sovereign of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
mountains, the virgin of the mountains, the lofty and
tremendous Bernina. On the left, instead, valleys
opened, surrounded by mountains less lofty, with broad
meadows still full green; at a gap in one of these, all
flourishing with vegetation, like an oasis confronting the
terrible chain of the Bernina, a country girl came towards
them, offering flowers. To conquer the agitation
that kept dominating him, Lucio made the carriage
stop. Buxom and blond and rosy, the country girl
offered bunches of fresh flowers which she had gathered
an hour ago, bunches of dark blue and purple gentians,
masses of Alpine orchids of a tender pink with dark
markings, and fresh edelweiss, still almost bathed in snow.</p>

<p>"Here, Lilian," he resumed in a still agitated voice,
"is a valley full of flowers, the Valley of Fieno, but it is
too far-away; here are its flowers."</p>

<p>And he took them all from the hands and arms of the
peasant girl and emptied them in Lilian's hands; the
rug and the whole carriage were covered with flowers,
and smiling, the peasant girl bade them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieu</i> as she
jingled the money in her rough hand. Lilian pressed the
flowers to her, smelt them, and buried her face in them
in her usual gentle way, while the carriage resumed,
more quickly, its way towards the lofty Bernina Pass.</p>

<p>"You have been on other occasions to the Bernina?"
she asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, several times: I have been everywhere."</p>

<p>"Also in this valley that you say is full of flowers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Lilian."</p>

<p>"And you have given these beautiful flowers to many
other women, haven't you?" she continued, looking at
him, with a shade of melancholy in her glance.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" he exclaimed, with a
vivacious nod, as if to abolish the past.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten them all," she concluded, without
looking at him, as if she were talking to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are <em>different</em>, Lilian," he said.</p>

<p>She believed him at once and smiled at him, herself
desirous of dispersing the cloud of sadness which had
passed over their souls.</p>

<p>"Have you ever climbed to the top of one of those
mountains? Have you climbed the Monte Bernina,
dear? Tell me everything, please."</p>

<p>"I climbed two or three times, Lilian, when I was
younger, bolder, and less lazy; not right to the Bernina,
dear, but to the Diavolezza beneath the Bernina."</p>

<p>"Is it far and difficult or high? Can one get there?
How I envy you! It must be so beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Beautiful and sad, Lilian&mdash;very sad. It is a landscape
that dazes and contracts the heart. Up there one
thinks of the many who at different times have attempted
to climb ever higher and have perished, Lilian.
Up there, too, it is such a strange country. Imagine
amidst all the whiteness a mountain completely black,
called Monte Perso, and there is also at its foot a glacier,
the Perso glacier; and, strange to say, a great space of
rocks and stones, all black, which cuts the glacier, the
Isle of Perso&mdash;why, one knows not. I have told you all,
Lilian."</p>

<p>"I should like to go there," she added, with all the
strength of her race.</p>

<p>The air became colder, as they reached the goal. The
whole region became more arid, and more outstanding
in their majesty the lofty peaks of the PalÃ¹ and the
Cambrena, the one completely white, the other streaked
with white and black in a peculiar palette of two colours&mdash;the
black rock and white ice.</p>

<p>"Are you cold, dear?" he asked tenderly.</p>

<p>"Yes, a little cold; just a little."</p>

<p>"Let us get down, dear; we are almost there. We
will walk to the Hospice along the lakes."</p>

<p>In helping her to descend he took her in his arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
like a child, to place her on the ground. Involuntarily
he pressed her to himself for a moment; he saw her
grow pale and he paled himself. He felt himself losing
his self-control. As they walked he gave her his arm
silently; the carriage drew away towards the Hospice
of the Bernina, which could be seen, like a far-off grey
point against the diverse brightness of the lakes. They
skirted the motionless waters of the first lake; around
its shores were neither trees, nor plants, nor flowers,
nor grass. There were only stones, blackish or yellowish
earth, and as they extended their glance ahead other
waters appeared, motionless, reflecting the whiteness of
the Cambrena, and the brown fillets of rocks which cut
the glacier&mdash;the deep black water of the Lago Nero, the
quite clear water of the Lago Bianco&mdash;while only a
tongue of brown earth separated the dark waters from
the clear; but there were no trees, nor flowers, nor
grass. Silently the two walked on; she now and then
oppressed by her vast surroundings, so strange and lifeless.
He pressed her closer to him as he led and supported
her, now and then murmuring, as in an amorous
refrain:</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Lilian, dear."</p>

<p>On the way they were pursuing, some carriages overtook
them, going towards the Hospice. Besides travellers,
wrapped in heavy wraps, and women in furs, the
carriages were loaded with baggage.</p>

<p>"They are descending to Italy," murmured Lucio.</p>

<p>"I envy them," she said, as if to herself.</p>

<p>"You ought not to envy anyone, dear," he repeated
ardently. "Wherever Lilian is, there is the country;
because there is love."</p>

<p>Like music, now tender and now violent, his words,
even vague, even imprecise, even indefinite to the questions
she often asked him, were like the music of softness
and passion; his words caressed her with a fresh breeze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
or ate into her heart like tongues of flame. For a
moment she closed her eyes and forgot that she had
received no reply to her question; she closed her eyes
and allowed herself to be destroyed by that flame.</p>

<p>People were coming and going before the Hospice;
the horses had been taken out of three or four carriages
to be fed and watered before resuming the journey to
Italy; also there were carts and carters. Everyone,
travellers, coachmen, carters, and hotel servants, were
in winter costume, and stamping their feet on the ground
against the cold. The deep grey of the hotel, which had
been a Hospice for travellers, and the brown, clear
waters of the motionless lakes beneath the snows and
glaciers of the Cambrena, the Carale, the Sassal Masone,
and, further away, the yoke of the Bernina, behind which
the road descended suddenly to Italy&mdash;all had the cold
and sad aspect of a winter landscape in the high mountains,
without a tree or flower.</p>

<p>"Would you stay a month here with me?" Lucio
asked Lilian at the door of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," she replied at once, with that
peculiar certainty of hers.</p>

<p>"Let us pretend that it is the first day," he whispered
into her ear, "that we are bridegroom and bride on our
honeymoon."</p>

<p>Again she became pale; again he felt too strong an
emotion preventing his self-control. Profoundly disturbed
they passed along the narrow, almost gloomy
corridor which divided the rooms of the Hospice, and
penetrated the little reading-room, which they found
invaded by a little caravan of Germans, men and women,
while the room was full of smoke from the pipes the men
were smoking. To avoid all this they went into the vast
dining-room, and around them hovered a waiter and
waitress, to ask if they were staying for the afternoon,
the night, or a week. Lucio only replied now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
with a vague smile, holding Lilian's hand in his, more
than ever enamoured, like a bridegroom. She was silent
and absorbed; the waiter and the waitress left them
by one of the windows of the room, where already those
who wanted luncheon were arriving. Behind the panes
Lilian and Lucio exchanged some rare words of childish,
sentimental intimacy, rather vibrant, and pronounced
softly, with an indescribable accent, and they gazed at,
perhaps without seeing, the lofty Cambrena, black with
rocks and white with ice, and the four little lakes which
almost seemed to advance from the back of the valley
and surround the grey Hospice, with their waters of
such strangely different hues.</p>

<p>"Are you still cold, adored little Lilian?"</p>

<p>"No, not any longer, dear; and you?"</p>

<p>"I? I am on fire, dear, sweet Lily."</p>

<p>"Do you find all this too sad? I believe you do not
like anything sad."</p>

<p>"I have no eyes for sadness, Lilian, when I am with
you."</p>

<p>Now, like children in love, they wandered from room
to room, finding nearly all the doors wide open. Within
the beds were made and covered with dark quilts; everything
was orderly, but empty and inanimate. Only in
one room, as they looked from the threshold, they saw
clothes thrown on to chairs, books upon a writing-table,
and fresh flowers in vases. They withdrew smiling,
afraid of being caught. The waiter who, as he came and
went, met them now and then in their little pilgrimage,
explained to them that since the Hospice had become
an hotel, every summer season people passed a week
there or a fortnight; even that year there had been
many till a few days ago, but with the rain and snow of
the last two days many had left for Switzerland and
Italy. Now only a few still remained; but at the
Hospice of the Bernina most people passed through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
travellers who were going to Vallettina or Switzerland,
and who all stopped for two or three hours to change
horses and have luncheon.</p>

<p>"On some days, when it is a good season, we have a
hundred to lunch," concluded the waiter, with importance.</p>

<p>"And to-day?" asked Lucio.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, just twenty."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry, Lilian?" asked Lucio, smiling at
her.</p>

<p>"Yes; I shall be glad of lunch."</p>

<p>"Let us go, dear, and choose our table; we will place
our flowers there."</p>

<p>They chose one in a remote corner of the vast dining-room,
and the banality of the table was adorned by the
dark gentians, the spiked orchids, and the fresh edelweiss;
like two children, looking around and fondling
each other's hands, they filled a vase and two glasses
with them. Lucio had the two places changed; instead
of facing Lilian, he wished to have her beside him and
while the waiter withdrew to serve their lunch, seated
at the little table, they were alone like two lovers for
the first time. Forgetful of everything except their love,
they began to talk, turning one to the other, their faces
close together, their words subdued, their smiles expressive
and suggestive, their glances now laughing and now
ardent; their hearts and fibres welled with the deep
sweetness of the idyll and ardour of passion. In the
dining-room, already more than twenty people were
lunching and talking loudly, especially the German
gathering; there was a noise of plates and knives, with
a smell of food that was diffused in the rather heavy
air of the room which was nearly always closed against
the cold; but, isolated in their corner, Lilian and Lucio
paid no heed to the others. Even they lunched: sometimes
their idyll or passion guided their actions, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
graciously puerile, now full of an unconquerable trembling,
as with a smile and a glance, or a fleeting squeeze
of the hand or gesture of tenderness, they lunched like
a newly married couple on the first day of their marriage;
the man seeking the woman's glass to place his lips where
she had placed hers, the woman offering half the fruit
which she had eaten, now and then forgetting to eat, to
look and smile at each other, as the waiter came and
went to and fro, silent, discreet, and indifferent, without
attempting to recall them to reality.</p>

<p>At the other tables everyone had finished lunch; the
Germans especially rose noisily, the men with their
congested faces, the women wearing on their blond,
yellowish hair the same masculine hats as their husbands
and fathers; but Lucio and Lilian at their table,
from which the things had been removed, allowed their
coffee to grow cold in their cups, and absently they
plucked off the petals of the Alpine orchids and edelweiss
with their fingers and scattered them on the table
in strange designs. They were now alone at the little
table in the corner, and knew nothing of what was happening
around them; only the silent, but questioning
and respectful presence of the waiter made them rise,
after Lucio had paid the bill.</p>

<p>"It will be very cold later for the return," said the
waiter suggestively, as if he were inviting them to stay.</p>

<p>A single, intense glance between them told of what
they were thinking. Agitatedly Lilian approached the
window from which they had looked out without seeing
the country; beside them, on a little table, a great book
lay open, with white pages signed with signatures,
mottoes, and dates, the album of the Bernina Hospice,
wherein every passer-by placed his name. To hide her
deep confusion, Lilian turned over some pages, stooping
to read, almost without understanding, some unknown
name, some words of admiration, remembrance, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
regret of those who had crossed the Bernina Pass. Suddenly
she perceived that Lucio was beside her, and that
he, too, was reading; more agitated, she did not turn,
as she tried to read more attentively, and together they
read a sentence in French, with two signatures, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
l'amour.&mdash;Laure et Francis</i>."</p>

<p>"Shall we write something, Lilian?" he whispered,
with his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

<p>They bent over the book together: she wrote first, in
French, in a rather trembling handwriting, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã toi, pour
la vie, pour la mort.&mdash;Lilian</i>." Promptly he wrote after
her, in a firm, decisive handwriting, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã toi, pour la vie,
pour la mort.&mdash;Lucio</i>," and a date. Their glances repeated,
affirmed, and swore what they had written, as
they went out of the deserted dining-room into the
narrow, semi-dark corridor, where there was no one. He
kept her for a moment in the half-light; embracing her
lightly, he drew her to him, and gave her a long kiss on
the lips, a kiss of love, which she returned as well. He
felt her reel as if lost; he, too, felt himself overcome with
joy. With a supreme effort he took her hand, supported
her, and led her away to the staircase of the Hospice, and
outside into the full light and open air, where for a
moment they stopped half blinded, without seeing anything,
without looking at each other, without recognising
each other, as if both were lost.</p>

<p>As if an indisputable need constrained them to fly
from some unknown danger, they walked along the
shores of the four little lakes, stopping to admire the
waters. They proceeded to where the tail of the Cambrena
glacier descends and winds, and they bent over
the spring that gushes from it to bathe their hands,
which were on fire; they went further, beyond the
yoke and the Bernina Pass, following the carts and
carriages which were in motion; they went by a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
hill, whence they saw a flock of sheep, with their shepherd
and guardian dog, proceeding with slow steps,
occasionally halting, and then resuming their way;
throughout the summer they had been in the Engadine,
and now, driven away by the cold, were descending
towards Italy, towards Poschiavo. They went forward
themselves on the road to Italy, and saw the little village
of La Rosa gleaming white below. They went everywhere,
tiring their bodies and their souls.</p>

<p>As the day declined they returned to the door of the
Hospice, but neither climbed the stairs again. They
remained at the threshold, exchanging some glances full
of a silent and immense sadness, but not a word opened
their lips to say how immense was their grief. The
carriage was ready, and the horses were tinkling their
bells; the waiter came down, carrying rugs and cloaks
and flowers. Lucio and Lilian jumped into the carriage
to return to St. Moritz Dorf. Again they looked at the
grey Hospice, which became gloomier in the declining
day, in that obscure corner of the earth, amidst its four
mysterious lakes, and an immense sadness bade farewell
to that tarrying-place of an hour of love. Then they left
in silence. Gloomy and stern, with hat almost lowered
over his eyes, Lucio first became calm by degrees, while
pale and sad, beneath her white veil, Lilian, too, grew
calmer. Gradually a gentleness, ever softer and more
persuasive, poured itself like balsam over their grief and
regret. They drew near to each other, affectionately
and simply; a tenderness united their hands and kept
them joined, a tenderness flowed from their few words, in
their voices, in their names pronounced now and then.
A tenderness seized, kept, and dominated them on their
return journey, amid the ever-increasing gloom of the
twilight, and when they reached their goal, both were
exalted by tenderness. But Lucio Sabini was also exalted
by renunciation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>In the embrasure of a window the tall figure of Otto von
Raabe was silhouetted more darkly against the shadow
of the night; he stooped a little to reply in a low voice
to the subdued and quiet questions of Paul LÃ©on, who
was standing beside him. Both had their faces turned
towards the room; every now and then they threw a
glance to the back of it. Outside, over their shoulders,
a portion of the sky shone with stars.</p>

<p>"To gather flowers?" asked the French poet, after a
long silence, his eyes apparently veiled by deep, inward
thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, to gather flowers, merely to gather flowers,"
murmured the German.</p>

<p>"Flowers? What flowers?" insisted the Frenchman
strangely.</p>

<p>"Some beautiful flowers he was told were up there;
he went to look for them."</p>

<p>"And did he find them?"</p>

<p>"He found them&mdash;he always used to find them&mdash;they
are still in his hands."</p>

<p>"They left them with him."</p>

<p>"Of course, look," said the German, pointing to the
back of the room.</p>

<p>On a little white bed lay the corpse of Massimo
Granata. The little body broken by the tremendous fall
from the precipice, at the skirts of the Pizota, was piously
laid out, and covered with a dark red, silk quilt, right to
the breast; and the little body of the poor rickety, deformed
man scarcely raised the covering. The head had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
been bandaged, and the pinched yellow countenance was
framed by the whiteness of its lines, whose eyes, full of
goodness and dreams, were closed for ever; and even
the face seemed diminished and like that of a child, dead
from some incurable disease endured since birth. The
pallid hands, long and fleshless, with knotty fingers, were
crossed on the breast, and they still clasped a little bunch
of unknown Alpine flowers; they clasped them in a last
act of love over the heart that beat no more. Some long
strings of mountain flowers had been scattered loosely
on the quilt, as if to surround in a garland of flowers the
corpse of Massimo Granata. On the simple furniture of
the simple room flowers had been placed here and there
in big and little vases; some were already withered,
which had been gathered two or three days before his
death; others, fresher, had been gathered recently,
before his last walk. On a night table before the humble
little bed there were an ivory crucifix and two candlesticks
with two lighted candles&mdash;all placed on a white
cloth. The two electric lamps of the room had been
veiled. Karl Ehbehard, the great consumption doctor,
was seated on one side at the foot of the bed, motionless
and silent, with bowed head.</p>

<p>"Karl Ehbehard was the first to be told," added Otto
von Raabe, shaking his head, fixing the closed, granite-like
face of the doctor with his indescribably blue eyes.
"He has known him for more than twenty years; he
loved him."</p>

<p>"Was his assistance of no avail?" Paul LÃ©on asked
very softly.</p>

<p>"Quite useless. Massimo had been dead for ten hours
when they brought him here."</p>

<p>"And who brought him?"</p>

<p>"Some shepherds up above," continued Otto von
Raabe, his voice breaking with mortal sadness. "Everyone
knew him at the Alp Laret, at the Alp Nova, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Fiori. Everyone used to greet him and speak to him.
You know that."</p>

<p>"Everywhere it was so," added Paul LÃ©on, with
lowered eyes.</p>

<p>"They saw him pass early in the morning. They
warned him that the ascent was rough and dangerous.
When, after so many hours, they did not see him
descending again, they climbed to look for him."</p>

<p>"Those shepherds are used to that."</p>

<p>"They are used to it, poor people. They searched a
long time, and at last they discovered him at the foot of
a precipice. It seems that the edge was hidden by those
flowers. He leant over too much."</p>

<p>"He died like a child in a fairy tale, like a child," said
the poet, his bright eyes now veiled.</p>

<p>Two other people entered without making a noise the
room where Massimo Granata was sleeping the first
night of his last sleep; the one was Giovanni Vergas,
an Italian gentleman, seventy years old, with beautifully
trimmed white beard and aristocratic and courteous
appearance; the other was Monsieur Jean Morel,
a Frenchman of seventy-five, thin, withered, without
any skin on his face, furrowed by a thousand little
wrinkles. Without speaking, they exchanged a nod
with Karl Ehbehard and the two who were standing in
the embrasure of the window, then they went and sat on
a little sofa of black horsehair, which leant against a wall,
and remained there silently. When the news of the
tragedy arrived, at seven o'clock in the evening, both
had been informed, and they had found Karl Ehbehard
there, who, in great silence, was laying out the fractured
body of the poor dead man. He washed and clothed it,
then placed it quietly again on the bed, covering it with
a quilt, then the good mistress of the house, Frau von
Scheidegg, scattered two rows of flowers around the
corpse, as she wept silently. Don Giovanni Vergas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Jean Morel had remained there a little, then they
promised to return. Now they had returned to watch
with the others the body of the lover of the mountains,
of him who had given his life for his love. Paul LÃ©on,
being informed, had arrived later than the others from
Sils Maria, and he was still asking questions to learn
everything, with a trembling and sorrowful curiosity,
from Otto von Raabe, of the beautiful, dreamy soul, of
the heart sensitive and soft in spite of his rough, wild
appearance.</p>

<p>Slowly, with cautious steps, they approached the
other two and sat beside them, forming a little restricted
circle, as they bent their heads to breathe forth the
sorrowful words of their sad conversation. Isolated, and
wrapped up in his silence, Karl von Ehbehard watched
over his friend and companion, his brother in love of the
mountains.</p>

<p>"How old could he be?" asked Jean Morel.</p>

<p>"Sixty, perhaps," replied Giovanni Vergas.</p>

<p>"He looked more," murmured Paul LÃ©on.</p>

<p>"He never was young; he never has been healthy;
he always suffered so much," explained Otto von Raabe.</p>

<p>"Only here he did not suffer," concluded the French
poet.</p>

<p>Some minutes of silence passed, each appeared immersed
in his own intimate thoughts.</p>

<p>"He has been here for many years," resumed Paul
LÃ©on. "I remember him for such a long time, and I
have been coming for twenty years."</p>

<p>"And I now for ten," concluded Jean Morel. "I was
one of the first here."</p>

<p>"He seems always to have lived in this furnished
room. The lady of the house was very fond of him; she
and her daughter are mourning below."</p>

<p>"He was poor, was he not?" asked Paul LÃ©on.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor," replied the German, "a very humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
professor; for relations he had one brother and some
nephews. We have sent them a telegram."</p>

<p>They were again silent. Frau von Scheidegg entered
discreetly. She carried a great mass of fresh flowers.
Approaching the circle of the four men, she said quietly:</p>

<p>"Two ladies, friends of the Herr Professor, sent them&mdash;the
Misses Ford and James. I will place the flowers
at his feet."</p>

<p>Advancing, and after crossing herself and saying a
short prayer, the old German woman deposited the mass
of fresh flowers on the quilt, where the two marble feet
of the defunct raised the silken fabric a little, on those
feet which had taken their last steps, and which would
never more impress their tread on the grass of the high
meadows, and amidst the dust of the broken rocks.
Then she crossed herself again, and left.</p>

<p>"Do you think, von Raabe, that the brother will
come to fetch him away?"</p>

<p>"No," replied a different voice. "No, he will not go
away."</p>

<p>It was Karl von Ehbehard who replied thus. He got
up from his place, joined the other four, and stood in
their midst, tall and thin, but breathing will and energy,
and the others looked at him with sympathy and admiration;
for they knew his history and life. The five
worshippers of the high mountains, the five lovers of the
Engadine were united in a group; Jean Morel, who had
been for forty years; Paul LÃ©on, the French poet, who
had been for twenty; Don Giovanni Vergas, the head
of a princely Italian house, who fled the yellow sands
and the blue of Italy for the white heights of the Grissons;
Otto von Raabe, the German millionaire banker,
who had all the poesy of nature and heart in his mind,
and Karl von Ehbehard, he who had found life up there,
and who was trying to give it back to others&mdash;all the
little group of mountain lovers were watching round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
another of them, who had been the victim of his love, on
his funeral night.</p>

<p>"He will not go away," replied Ehbehard, "too much
money is wanted to take away a corpse to Italy, and
the Granata are poor. Our friend will rest here among
us&mdash;&mdash;" and suddenly the hard, cold voice broke.</p>

<p>"We ought to give him a great procession to-morrow,"
exclaimed Paul LÃ©on, after glancing at the bandaged face
of the dead man, which seemed like that of a child.
"Carry him away loaded with flowers, through the
broad roads, and give him a triumph, this hero of the
mountains."</p>

<p>"That will not be possible," said Karl von Ehbehard,
his voice suddenly becoming hard.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Otto von Raabe.</p>

<p>"Because <em>they</em> won't allow it," said the doctor roughly.</p>

<p>"Who won't allow it? Who?" asked Paul LÃ©on,
with agitation.</p>

<p>"All do not wish it; no one wishes it," replied the
great doctor bitterly. "The people in the hotels of the
Dorf do not wish to see the dead, do not wish to know of
disease; they have a horror of all that. These pleasure-seekers
have for a motto, '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Evviva la vita!</i>' They want
to enjoy their pleasures here to the last without being
disturbed; so the authorities, hotel-keepers, and others
try in every way to prevent these pleasure-seekers from
seeing a melancholy spectacle, for fear that they will
leave two or three days sooner, or even one day. When
people die here, no one knows when they are taken to
the cemetery; no one is aware of it."</p>

<p>"What cruelty!" said Otto von Raabe sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"What infamy!" cried Paul indignantly.</p>

<p>"And shall we carry poor Massimo away thus?"
asked Giovanni Vergas, trembling with horror.</p>

<p>"We shall bear him away the same as the others,"
said Doctor Karl von Ehbehard gloomily; "at dawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
when all the pleasure-seekers are sleeping, we shall carry
him away on a simple bier, covered with a white cloth,
and carried on the shoulders of two strong men, without
any other funeral pomp, and we shall have to climb up
through the wood from the Dorf, along steep and unknown
paths, so that no one may meet us or see us, so
there will only be us to accompany him, we who loved
him and love the same things that he loved."</p>

<p>There was a lugubrious silence, and if the eyes of all
those men were not shedding tears, weeping was within
their desolate souls. Meanwhile two people entered quietly,
approached the corpse, and contemplated it&mdash;Lucio
Sabini and Lilian Temple. Lucio Sabini, too, had been
warned to come and see the unfortunate man who had
perished on high in a morning of the declining August,
holding in his hands a bunch of flowers, and who had
lain for hours at the foot of a precipice, and had been
brought back on a bier of tree trunks, covered by the
rough garments of the shepherds who had found him, to
the bed where he had slept for twenty beautiful seasons
amidst his mountains. Lucio promised to return, and
had done so, accompanied by Lilian. The English girl
was wearing a black dress and hat, and her pure, virginal
face seemed whiter than ever, and more blond her soft
hair. Side by side they gazed at the deformed face, with
its pointed cheek-bones and large, pallid mouth, the
face that had suffered so much and had never had peace
and joy save amid the lofty peaks, near the sky, in
silent, benignant solitude, amid the aroma of trees and
the fragrance of leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Massimo," said Lucio, as if to himself.</p>

<p>"Do not weep for him," said the firm, soft voice
of Lilian beside him, "you should not weep for
him."</p>

<p>He questioned her with his glance.</p>

<p>"He died for his passion and his dream; we ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
envy him, and not weep for him," said the girl, seriously
and sincerely.</p>

<p>She added no more. They had now joined the other
five in a single group at the back of the death chamber.</p>

<p>Karl Ehbehard said to them:</p>

<p>"We will accompany him through the Waldpromenade,
from St. Moritz Dorf towards Chassellas, to the
cemetery of St. Moritz Bad, to the little solitary cemetery
amidst the woods and meadows, beneath the gentle
Suvretta, opposite the majestic Margna, in front of the
lakes of Silvaplana and Sils. There we will bury him
among the humble Engadiners, and among those
strangers who come here from other countries to die, as
he came."</p>

<p>Lilian gave Lucio a sweet, expressive glance, as if to
remind him how in that place, in the soft summer
twilight, they had known each other; and he remembered
and smiled, sadly and sweetly.</p>

<p>"He will sleep there, like so many others who have
died here, without anyone being aware of it," added the
doctor, relapsing into his thoughts and dreams.</p>

<p>The English girl drew near to him softly.</p>

<p>"You need not weep for him to-morrow or to-day,
Doctor," she said in a quiet, soft voice; "I am sure that
he desired to be buried there in the little cemetery; I am
sure that it is the best place for his long rest."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>After the snow of the 26th of August a pure sky was
resplendent in vain in the Upper Engadine, an exaltation
for the eye and the imagination; in vain a wondrous
golden sun enlivened everything, in vain did an even
more victorious and absorbing fascination emanate from
the whole countryside, and in vain the beauty of things
became more absorbing and penetrating. Everything
was in vain for a crowd that wished to depart, and
nothing availed to keep it now that it was bent on
fleeing. It was a crowd that no longer had eyes, or
feelings, or nerves, with which to see and feel and respond;
it was a crowd that was blind, deaf, and inert
to every joy-bearing impression, dominated and absorbed
as it was by its desire of departing. With the
same impetus with which it had arrived from all parts
and every distant country a month ago, had violently
and feverishly invaded hotels, <em>pensions</em>, and villas, filling
them to overflowing, had peopled the most remote and
deserted corners, had placed its outposts on the most
impervious slopes and climbed the loftiest peaks: with
this same irresistible impetus by which it had conquered
and fashionably devastated the silence, calm, and poesy
of the Upper Engadine, that crowd was now turning its
back, departing, and fleeing, without anyone or anything
availing to delay its departure for an hour or a day.
But the departure did not seem like a departure, it
resembled a precipitous flight, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>, as if
there had been a summons to some lofty duty or to the
enjoyment of some great pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>For a week the little station of St. Moritz Dorf had
been besieged by the crowd, to book seats in <em>wagons-lits</em>
in the expresses of the great international lines for Paris,
London, Brussels, Berlin, Frankfort, and it would leave
the station disconsolate, because for days the places in
the <em>wagons-lits</em> on all lines had been taken; for at the
mere idea of being forced to continue its sojourn for a
day or an hour in the Engadine, the despairing crowd
caused it to rain telegrams, offering to pay to have the
<em>wagons-lits</em> and first-class carriages increased, in a state
of agitation at every little obstacle that hindered its
departure and flight. For a week the post office of St.
Moritz Bad had been hedged in by a crowd booking
places in the mail-coaches that descended twice a day
into Italy, but so many people wanted to leave that
places were lacking and every day the office added extra
carriages, but even these were insufficient; so the
exasperated crowd that wished to descend pell-mell
into Italy booked special carriages at a high fee, just to
get away on the day and the hour, without giving a
glance behind. For a week conversations overlapped.</p>

<p>"I have my places for Tuesday evening...."</p>

<p>"I have telegraphed to Zurich...."</p>

<p>"I am expecting a telegram from Basle...."</p>

<p>"We hired a carriage from Tiraboschi to descend...."</p>

<p>"Frau Goertz has given up her places in the <em>wagons-lits</em>
to me: she is returning to Italy by carriage from the
Bernina...."</p>

<p>"If I am unable to find places in <em>wagons-lits</em> I shall
descend to Chiavenna, and go from thence to the frontier
at Chiasso."</p>

<p>Never had the Upper Engadine been so beautiful. Its
surrounding colours and its breezes had indescribable
charms in those last days of August. It seemed to change
its aspect a hundred times, each more graceful than
the other, it was a medley of the brightest colours, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
appeared to be swimming in a divine, crystalline air, and
to be poised amidst the most vivid freshness. So sensitive
souls, hearts secretly pierced, spirits being poisoned by
slow poison&mdash;some rare soul, some rare heart and spirit&mdash;at
such exquisite beauty felt themselves trembling
with a new, mysterious life, felt themselves in those last
days healed of all their old bleeding wounds and freed
from gall and bitterness, as if a powerful and unknown
medicine had performed such a miracle. But when even
for them the hour of departure drew near, a great regret,
a great grief, and an immense nostalgia oppressed and
suffocated their hearts.</p>

<p>But if by chance a long sigh of nostalgia for the Engadine
land escaped their oppressed hearts, where they had
found a balm for all their wounds, if this sigh became a
word or an expression, scandalised, the crowd would turn
and brutally tell the poor man or woman that it was
ridiculous, yes, ridiculous, to want to remain even a
single day longer. Brutally the crowd reduced to silence
the timid man or tender woman who would still have
liked, in those few beautiful September days, to console,
heal, and free themselves amidst the grace, purity, and
simplicity of the Engadine. Silently timid man and
tender woman bowed the head, expressing all the grief
of broken dreams, the nostalgia for things that would
have consoled, healed, and freed them and which they
must implacably leave.</p>

<p>Implacably the crowd bustled, racketing everywhere,
with hurry, anxiety, and despair, to arrange its departure.
In hotel rooms there was a dull and continuous
shock of boxes being put down and lifted, of heavy
luggage being filled and strapped, of opening and closing
of wardrobes, with a continuous, nervous ringing of
electric bells. The coming and going in corridors and
<em>salons</em> of managers, waiters, chambermaids, servants,
and porters was vertiginous; the offices of the hotels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were in a continuous bustle, getting ready bills and
cashing money at all hours; the porters no longer had a
minute's peace, taking a hundred orders, at the same
time, for a hundred things incidental to departure, and
every evening, at the great desk of the head porter, on a
long black board, written in chalk, were the numbers of
the rooms which would be free on the following day, and
the number of passengers who would be leaving. Joyfully,
brutally, the crowd jostled before the blackboard
and read there that a part of them, an ever greater part,
would be leaving to-morrow by such and such a train,
by such and such a post-carriage.</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven people left this morning."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, see, thirty-eight are leaving."</p>

<p>"On Sunday is the great departure from here, seventy-two
people."</p>

<p>From day to day the last words were said, the last acts
accomplished rapidly and anxiously. In the hotels the
crowd surged round the telephone boxes impatiently
waiting its turn to telephone to Zurich, or Geneva, or
Basle, giving orders, changing itineraries and instructions,
receiving affirmative, or adverse replies. The
crowd surged in the roads at the doors of the five or six
banks, to withdraw the balance of their last letters of
credit, to send away their last sum of money; they
surged from shop to shop, to buy the last pretty and
useful things from the Engadine, and the last souvenirs
of St. Moritz and the Grissons, to take away for relations
and friends; they surged at the post office to expedite
the last registered letter, to stamp the last picture post
cards, to send the last telegrams. But the crowd surged
more or less compactly, with one object only in every
place, from the little wooden gallery where the music
plays in the morning, near the "Kurhaus," to the larger
gallery at the new springs by the "Stahlbad," while the
serenade from <em>Pagliacci</em> resounded sadly; they surged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confiserie</i> of De Gasparis to the tea-rooms of
the "Kulm," from the pastry shop of Hanselmans to
tea at the Golf Club, as they came and went on foot or
tram, with the single idea of looking for friends to say
good-bye to them. Every moment at these and other
places, beneath the beautiful porticoes of the Bad, at
the Inn bridge, before the vestibules of the hotels, on
the footpaths of the Dorf, at the carriage door, there
were meetings, little cries of joy, feigned sighs, greetings
and leave-takings.</p>

<p>"... I will look you up."</p>

<p>"... Of course I will come."</p>

<p>"... We leave this evening."</p>

<p>"... At Paris within three weeks."</p>

<p>"... To-morrow at Lucerne, on Tuesday at Geneva."</p>

<p>"... At Varrenna, on the 15th of September."</p>

<p>Early in the morning horses pawed the ground and
tinkled their little bells before the main doors of the
hotels, to warn those who were to descend in special
carriages to Italy. Before the post office, the ordinary
and special post-carriages were drawn up in a line, one
behind the other, while postilions busied themselves
around them, and porters continuously sought out and
piled up fresh luggage on the carts which followed the
carriages. Everywhere there was a rapid movement, a
great hurrying of those who were setting out at this
early hour, who had few friends and acquaintances and
an indescribable anxiety to get away, speeded at the
hotel door only by the very sleepy under-secretary,
speeded at the post office merely by the under-porter,
leaving without companions and without flowers,
hurriedly, securing themselves in their carriages and
settling themselves comfortably, without a glance at the
country they were leaving, without a farewell as they
went on their way. Amidst the cracking of postilions'
and coachmen's whips and the tinkling of bells they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
on their way tranquilly and serenely, now that they had
started for the Maloja, the Val Bregaglia&mdash;and Italy.</p>

<p>The others set out in carriages, much later, towards
Italy, at ten or eleven, those who were in an immense
hurry to fly, but who had to take leave of so many people
in the hotels, greet so many friends on the square, return
thanks and accept and render homage, receive flowers,
give <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonbonniÃ¨res</i>, all with an increasing anxiety which
worldly politeness did not succeed in concealing, with a
joyful excitement which was hidden by a false regret, as
if to console those who were still remaining for two or
three days, and who had no need of consolation, since
they in their turn would leave. So on one side and the
other words of farewell tried in vain to be sorrowful,
though as a matter of fact the lady who was about to
leave was secretly glad that she was being surrounded
by this homage for the last time, and the man was
secretly glad to be rid of another of his relations in the
high mountains. The husband for private reasons, good
and bad, was glad to be going elsewhere, and the children
were at the height of joy and mischief, as was the case
every time they changed ground. A little crowd surrounds
the carriage; hats are lifted once more, the
horses spring forward: the travellers wave their gloved
hands, veils flutter, bells tinkle, and they are away over
the Inn bridge, towards the Maloja, the Val Bregaglia,
and Italy. Other carriages are with them which have
arrived from the Dorf hotels, Campfer, Silvaplana, and
Sils, and all unite to form a cortÃ¨ge of noisily rolling
carriages, of trotting horses, cracking whips, tinkling
bells, fluttering veils, without any of those who were on
their way giving a glance to the mountains, lakes, and
meadows that they are leaving behind them, without
any act of farewell for the things around them.</p>

<p>Those who had just taken leave of them, bringing
flowers and gifts with a wish for a pleasant journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
would remain for a few minutes to talk quietly without
the least melancholy, afterwards to disperse among the
ever less frequented roads of the Bad. They went to see
about their final affairs, for within a day or two they,
too, would be far-away. Many were getting ready for
the principal trains leaving that day or on the morrow&mdash;the
two daily expresses whose departure from St. Moritz
Dorf took place amidst the terrible hurrying of the
crowd, which at last left for all the countries of the
world. Away, away, they went from the Upper Engadine
without a glance or a nod of farewell&mdash;for the train
pierced two tunnels in succession and was immediately
at and beyond Samaden&mdash;already <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i> and forgetful,
already anxious and longing for another life elsewhere,
where their fantasies, nerves, and feelings should have
other visions, other impressions, and other sensations.</p>

<p>Carriages and omnibuses arrived at a sharp trot from
St. Moritz Bad and St. Moritz Dorf, full of people who
were turning their backs with such hurry and furor.
The pretty, clean little station was groaning with people,
was heaped with piles of enormous luggage, and amidst
ladies, men and children waved baskets and bunches of
flowers, baskets of fresh fruit tied with ribbons and
bows, large <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonbonniÃ¨res</i> of Swiss chocolate&mdash;all gifts and
souvenirs for those who were leaving from those who,
impatient, were secretly waiting the brief flight of the
hours to go in their turn. Ah, these accompaniments of
flowers and gifts, what a last essay of worldly rivalry!
What a steeplechase between Madame and Miss, each
hoping to have more than the other, more than their
dearest friend and dearest enemy, hoping to be surrounded
by the most followers at the station&mdash;by a
really big group, while the others should have only five,
or six, or eight, but no more. It was a profitable business
in these last few days for the florists, confectioners, and
vendors of souvenirs. There were retinues of bouquets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of baskets and bunches of flowers amongst the crowd at
the little station, flowers wrapped in wrappings of tissue
paper were held in the hands of ladies, children, and
maids, an occasional bunch pressed to the bosom, the
most precious of the bundle of flowers! Ah, how the
ladies who were leaving counted them! How they paled
with envy the day on which the Marquise de Vieuxcastel
left, as they counted, astonished and irritated, the flowers
in a hundred shapes that followed her in a floral crown,
accompanied by friends, relations, and servants&mdash;the
Marquise who was Grace personified, to whom all the
ladies gave forty-five or fifty years and all the men
thirty; nevertheless, she was full of beauty and youth
from the depths of her beautiful young soul. And what
deep anger on the part of little Madame d'Allart, when
at the station she perceived that at least four of the
bouquets she expected were missing, while, as a matter
of fact, the pale, blond, reserved and thoughtful Comtesse
de la FertÃ© Guyon had more than she&mdash;the tower of
ivory! the tower of ivory to whom no one dare pay
court! And what grotesque anger on the part of
Madame Mentzel, who arrived at the station with but
five followers and seven bouquets of flowers, one of
which she had bought herself, at the sight of floral garlands
that were clasped on all sides by the crowd, by all
these ladies of the "Palace," even by the Comtesse
Pierre de GÃ©rard, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande Comtesse</i>, the noble lady of
the self-conscious and almost statuesque posings, with a
face that seemed almost that of a Sphinx, pure, ardent,
and silent. Although she was considered the proudest
and most distant of that assembly, even she was surrounded
by friends, and Madame Mentzel went about
exclaiming, from one end to the other of the little station,
that unfortunately all her friends had left before her.</p>

<p>Even in their departure these ladies of the "Palace"
were created to exasperate and annoy those from other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
hotels&mdash;all the poor profane! They left&mdash;these Olympians&mdash;with
an even more Olympic air than usual, with
a contempt that was totally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i>, with a serene pride,
so much so that it seemed as if a cloud, mythologically
speaking, should bear them away and not a trivial train.
Each had thirty or forty packages to which the railway
and railway people servilely gave preference. They had
reserved carriages and saloons for themselves alone.
Madame Azquierda was followed by eight or ten servants,
who carried a hundred things into her reserved carriage&mdash;pillows,
her bridge table, her table to prepare lunch, a
bird-cage of thirty rare birds: Madame de Aguilar
travelled with two English detectives to watch over her
jewels and took with her four guests whom she was transporting
to the shores of the North Sea, even to Heligoland,
where her yacht of two thousand tons, <em>La Gitana</em>,
would take them, together with other guests, for a cruise
in the North Sea. In fact, these Olympian ladies of the
"Palace," as if to damn the profane, were leaving for,
shall we say, the most unexpected countries; none of
them, just to be different, were making for the usual,
banal places. One was going to Munich to hear a cycle
of Mozart's works; another was going to England and
the Scotch lakes, another to Bruges la Morte; another
was going to Umbria, to Perugia; another in automobile
to Bohemia&mdash;each to a strange place, for strange
reasons, through artistic, literary, or Ã¦sthetic snobbishness,
or perhaps&mdash;<em>perhaps</em>&mdash;through real taste, but certainly
they were making a different journey, looking for
a different atmosphere, sighing after different impressions.
In fact, Madame Lawrence, whom many had
dubbed a Jewess, who never went to church, to do something
odd, was going on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of
Lourdes. Biting her lips, Donna MercÃ©dÃ¨s de Fuentes,
after inquiring from everyone, learnt that no one from
the "Palace" was coming with her to Lucerne for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande semaine</i>. It was enough to drive one mad, and
only Don Giorgio Galanti could console her a little on
the day of departure, for he had left over a little bunch
of four splendid roses&mdash;how one knows not&mdash;that had
found no billet; he offered them to her, so she arranged
a meeting with him for October in Paris at the ElysÃ©e
Palace.</p>

<p>But in spite of the Olympian disdain of the ladies at
the station the hour of departure, with the crowd that
thronged more densely, grew vertiginous. Waves of
movement in every sense passed over the crowd: a
noise first dull, then higher and higher, became a deafening
din, amidst the crashing of carts, the rumbling of
baggage, the thousand voices and calls, the arrival of
fresh carriages and unloading of fresh luggage, and over
all was the invincible anxiety to clamber into the train,
to close the eyes, to be transported far, far-away from
the Engadine, not even putting the head out to see how
everything was disappearing to right and left, as if now
the Engadine were a dream that was over, as if it had
never been either reality or dream.</p>

<p>The sky was of a sapphire blue&mdash;of the deep sapphire
of the east&mdash;over the Engadine, liquid gold was the sun,
like limpid rock crystal the atmosphere, like ambrosia
the air, the dawn pink with a thousand rosy tints, the
noontide trembling with light and heat, the twilight of a
thousand shades of purple, and the nights palpitated
indescribably with stars, as never before. Amidst such
splendour and softness its roads were thinned of passersby,
and no longer clouds of dust arose; the paths and
little white tracks amongst the immense meadows were
no longer crossed except by few people, and for hours
and hours by no one. The little donkeys with their red
plush saddles, which had taken ladies and children for
outings and excursions, had disappeared from the square
before the public gardens; slowly donkeys and drivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had taken the Bernina road to return to Vallettina.
Before the Kursaal of the Maloja the Comese boats of
the lake of Sils had been beached; the electric launch
on the lake of St. Moritz had ceased its trips, and was
drawn up to its winter garage; the gondoliers had gone
with their gondolas to Italy. One day the music played
no more in the little wooden gallery by the HÃ´tel Kurhaus,
another day there was no music in the great gallery
at the "Serpentquelle," and gradually the musicians
began to gather together, to pack their luggage, and set
off for the Italian lakes and Milan. Some of the shops
of the Bad closed towards the end of August; the kiosks
for jewellery, lace, and flowers lowered their iron shutters
and all Tiraboschi's coachmen hurried to leave with
their horses by easy stages towards Italy, Lombardy,
Piedmont, and the French frontier, to arrive after a
couple of months at Nice and Monte Carlo, where they
would do service for the greater winter season. Gradually
waiters and chambermaids, major-domos and
grooms left, and there remained but the staff, which,
within a week or ten days, would also have disappeared.
At certain hours of the day there was a deep silence; no
longer at night did the "Kulm," the Grand Hotel, the
"Palace," the "Schweizerhof," flame with their lights
reflected in the lake, but only a feeble, flickering light
threw some slender spark thereon. A great peace, not
melancholy, now spread over the Upper Engadine; a
solemn calm stretched to its farthest borders. Above
mountains, fields, lakes, in almost deserted country
roads, solitude and silence was enhancing the beauty
of the Upper Engadine&mdash;its incomparable, intangible
beauty.</p>

<p>During the last week the little affairs of love and
passion, of big and little flirts, had strangely changed in
aspect and substance. Nearly all had become more
intense, as if the imminent separation had caused their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
modest flames to flash forth, rendering more serious and
sad the gay caprice of a month. Every morning in the
pine woods, full of the freshest perfumes, in the little
paths one met nothing but amorous couples, some silent
and slow, with lowered eyes, some rapid and agitated in
their conversation, and on the seats in the little woods,
and by the lake only flirting couples were to be seen,
some melancholy, and contemplating with distracted
eyes the even more solitary landscape, others exchanging
long, significant glances. In front of the windows of
Faist's library, amongst the Sorrento woods and tortoiseshell
of Pasquale Gallone, at florists', at kiosks where the
picture post cards were on sale, these couples of every
age and nation and condition stopped to look for a book,
buy a little present, exchange bouquets of flowers and
post cards, pressing their hands suggestively, after a
sentimental exchange. But these meetings and exchanges
of little pledges happened at all hours till late at night,
even in the vestibules, halls, and <em>salons</em> of the large
hotels. There was not a corner unoccupied, not a divan
that did not accommodate two persons, not a table at
which two heads were not bent, while a gold pencil or
silver pen raced rapidly over the page of an open volume,
on the white pages of a volume of souvenirs. Heads
were raised, a long, melancholy, and passionate glance
between the twain expounded the motto, the name, and
the date. There was now less dancing in the ballrooms,
and only a few courageous couples gyrated to the last
tunes of the orchestra; but the love-making increased
even more, couples sat side by side, always conversing in
a low voice, heeding not the calls of the "Boston" and
"two-step." Couples were in the embrasures of windows
and verandah, or promenading in the farthest corridors
or before the buffet, drinking together a drink of the
same colour, each eating a pastry of the same shape;
couples withdrew to the <em>salon</em>, the billiard and reading-rooms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
pretending to interest themselves in things they
saw not; only to get far-away. Wherever one could
take a cup of tea, in hotels, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cafÃ©s</i>, restaurants, above at
the <em>Unteralpina</em>, below at the <em>Meieri</em>, everywhere pairs
of flirts were seated at the tables; and the tea smoked
invitingly and in vain in the cups which the absent and
absorbed couples forgot to sip. Everywhere mothers
and fathers, relations and tutors, as with final complacency
they thought that to-morrow, perhaps, all
would be over, and not wishing to sadden the last days,
pretended more than ever to see and know nothing, not
to be aware of anything or understand. They were the
last concessions of maternal indulgence, which preferred
not to exalt or exasperate the last meetings, the last
glances and hand-claspings.</p>

<p>In glances and words, in scribbled mottoes and hand-squeezes,
in some fleeting kiss exchanged at the back of
a deserted room, behind the pages of a large illustrated
paper or the hedge of the tennis-court, there was always
a promise and an oath of eternal love and fidelity. Who
did not promise? Who did not swear? The Comtesse
di Durckeim, the eccentric Hungarian, smiling bitterly
on the last day, told her women friends that she was
bound by an everlasting oath to five of her suitors, and
that she had given them tryst in five different countries,
while she herself would go to a sixth country in search of
an unknown lover&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'inconnu, ma chÃ¨re amie, l'inconnue,
celui que j'aime toujours plus que les autres</i>. Lia Norescu
had given at least ten promises and received ten solemn
oaths&mdash;the astonishing girl with a soul full of ashes and
poison&mdash;but as a matter of fact she left with only one
flirt, an elderly, wealthy gentleman, who, perhaps, would
have married her, but she was subtle and elusive, and
would not let herself be taken; another flirt, a youth
whom she liked very much, was waiting for her at Ostend,
a handsome youth, who pretended to be rich, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faire</i>? Don Giorgio Galanti, the fascinating, astute
Italian, had sworn eternal fidelity to numerous flirts at
the Bad, the Dorf, and Pontresina; but he went to join
an enchanting woman whom he loved at the Semmering,
near Vienna, and who loved him, but who could only
meet him two or three times a year for a single day at
a time, in far-away and different districts, a real romance,
which he concealed beneath his cynical aspect of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viveur</i>.
The Marquise d'Allart, small, exquisite, gracefully corrupt,
believing neither what was told her nor what she
said, gathered promises and took oaths in a half-pretty
and sentimental tone, with a veil of melancholy in her
voice; and later, when alone in her room, full of little
gifts and flowers, when she was to sleep her last night in
the Engadine, she laughed cruelly at herself and others,
showing her fierce little teeth to her mirror.</p>

<p>Madame Lawrence, indifferent, unfeeling, listened to
promises and oaths, and gathered them with an expressive
smile, but she made none in exchange as now and
then she uttered some banal word, perhaps purposely
insipid. Once again her suitors and flirts were indignant
at her want of feeling, and some of them took their leave,
deciding not to run after her or to see her no more;
others, though angry, believed that time and other encounters
and opportunities would pierce the heart of this
woman who was too beautiful, and disguised their feelings.
The other professional beauty, the divine Miss
Miriam Jenkyns, was even more terrible in her indifference,
since she tranquilly rejected promises and oaths,
declared against the inutility of the lies, and the vacuity
of these sentimental forms, and beautiful, imperturbable,
Olympian, but perhaps hugging to her heart a secret that
was torturing and killing her, she discouraged, repressed,
and settled all her suitors and flirts, carrying her mystery
behind her pale, pure brow.</p>

<p>Who did not promise? Who did not swear? Amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sylvan perfumes, along the shores of the lakes, amidst
the fields where the last flowers of summer still bloomed,
in flower-clad gardens, in ballrooms, in reading-rooms,
in solitary terraces, on white verandahs where the moon
was contemplated, more especially on the last evening
and morning, at the last moment, before a carriage whose
horses were pawing the ground impatient to start, before
the closing doors of the train, lovers, flirts, and suitors, a
little pale, a little moved, promised in a low voice, made
oath subduedly even if convinced they were lying; even
if cynical they were moved. Here and there one was
deeply moved, taken and conquered, by pure sentiments
and a sincere love.</p>

<p>On a clear morning the handsome youth, the tall,
blond, elegant Pole, Ladislaus Woroniecki, with the
dreamy eyes, left for his own country; he was in love
with the beautiful, fragile invalid, Else von Landau, who
was remaining in the Upper Engadine, having decided to
live and grow well, and who would remain there for a
year or two. She had accompanied him to say good-bye
at the station, and the two held each other's hands
without caring for the public. Their loving eyes spoke
a true promise, and a true oath, which they would
maintain.</p>

<p>Miss Ellis Robinson was leaving for Paris, the charming
American old maid of forty; her Italian flirt, the
gracious Don Carlo Torriani, who had followed her with
courteous obstinacy, besieged her with lively but sincere
court, striving to make her renounce her part of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux
garÃ§on</i>&mdash;this Italian lover&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le beau Torriani beau pour
moi</i>," as she smilingly spoke of him&mdash;suddenly understood
that as she promised him to return soon to Italy,
certainly in November, promising him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"d'y penser un
peu ... Ã  cette chose ... seulement un peu</i>," as she
smiled no more, as she looked at him seriously, that the
charming old maid of forty would keep her vow. Vows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and promises which were true, vows and promises which
were half true, and vows and promises which were false,
each man and woman uttered them on those last clear
nights and limpid mornings&mdash;cynics, sceptics, indifferents,
ingenuous, or impassioned, all felt a dull agitation
disturbing them, all tried in vain to control themselves
and to laugh and smile. Only those who had had a
caprice, a flirtation, a little affair of passion, or love,
those who had known how to play with love or whom
love had mocked, those who had been chained for a short
time, or those who were chained for ever, they only, even
the most sceptical and most superficial&mdash;and much more
so those with feeling heart and soul&mdash;experienced the
sharp bitterness of having to leave that country, were
pierced by the nostalgia for all they were abandoning,
and turned to gaze at for the last time, to smile at and
bless for the last time the Upper Engadine.</p>

<p>Divine Engadine, beloved, adored, blessed by all those
who have discovered the face of love and perhaps of
happiness. While the pleasure-seekers forgetfully left
her without regret, seeking other surroundings with
other pleasures, with an inextinguishable thirst that inundated
the hearts and souls, while the snobs left without
understanding anything, diseased with snobbishness as
they were, and anxious to find other circles where they
could abandon themselves to their ridiculous infirmity;
while the vicious and corrupt fled, shrugging their
shoulders, annoyed, in fact, because they had been unable
to develop, as they believed and hoped, their vice and
corruption; while the indifferent, from whom everything
glides away, left without an impression or a recollection,
while all those pleasure-seekers, snobs, the vicious, corrupt,
and indifferent were dragged along by the same
vortex to live elsewhere the same life, while for all of
them the magnificent beauty of things and the majesty
of the deserted heights had been useless and vain&mdash;only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
those who had loved, for a day, for an hour, for ever in
the Engadine, took her away with them in their hearts
as a sweet, ineffaceable memory. They delighted in
her as the country of their dearest poesy, they shut her
up in their fantasy, as the purest of their dreams, they
blessed her in the name of their love. The divine Engadine
had offered all her most precious treasure to them,
even to those seized by a light caprice, even to those
transported by a little flirtation in a summer night in
the high mountains, even to lovers' tears, even to those
who must forget everything at once: the divine Engadine
had given to those men and women all her dearest
gifts. Divine Engadine! Her winding paths amongst
the soft verdure of the meadows had felt the light steps
of lovers who had gone along them in forgetfulness of
every other human thing; her shady paths amid the
salient woods had given their odoriferous freshness to
the couples which had traversed them, holding arm or
hand; the small singing waters of the brooks hidden
amidst grass and rocks had murmured to lovers' ears
the music of gaiety and caress; the great, motionless,
and shining waters of the lakes had opened before the
rocking boats which bore the lovers; had brilliantly reflected
the faces of those who had curiously gazed into
them from the bank; and the lofty mountain had
gathered the more daring, who, in joyous desire of peril,
bore their love up there, towards the white and terrible
peaks. All her favours&mdash;light, flowers, and perfumes&mdash;the
Upper Engadine had conceded to those who loved
her. She had only been beautiful, pure, luminous, the
fount of health and life to her old admirers of half a century,
of thirty and twenty years, and one of them she
had pressed to her bosom for ever in a mortal embrace;
only to the humble sick who had come there to seek
peace, solitude, and strength. And for those who would
never return again, in spite of their nostalgia, as for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
who would return the following year, in sentimental
pilgrimage, the Upper Engadine remained for them, with
all her precious treasures and admirable gifts, a country
of well-being and dreams; and later, they, on hearing
her name or seeing her outlines on a post card, or hearing
mention of some high peak, would experience a tremor
of inconsolable regret.</p>

<p>Thus in these last days they were passing together in
the Upper Engadine, Mabel Clarke and Vittorio Lante,
in spite of the happy certainty of their love and future,
in spite of the fact that they were going thence together
to Paris, where Mrs. Annie Clarke was feverishly anxious
to arrive, requiring a stay of at least six weeks there for
all her dresses and hats&mdash;thirty dresses and sixty hats for
herself and daughter&mdash;before setting out for America;
in spite of the certainty that in New York the great
parent, the great John Clarke would at once consent
to the marriage of his daughter with Don Vittorio
Lante, Prince of Santalena (there was the title in
the family), because John Clarke loved his daughter,
and would, like every good American, respect her wish;
in spite of all that was smiling on their youth and
troth, every now and then they looked at the country
where they had known each other, where they had
grown fond of each other, and a light cloud obscured
their eyes. Their young nerves vibrated with the fullness
of life, and absorbed the deep pleasure of being young,
healthy, and of loving: but in the presence of the places
where their stay in the high mountains had unfolded
itself, in its episodes, now gay, now sentimental, they
experienced a feeling of unexpected melancholy. Mabel
Clarke did not want Vittorio to love her too much
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">all'italiana</i>, as she said, that is, with currents of vague
melancholy, with mysterious languors, obscure currents
of sadness which characterise Italian love; she did not
like that&mdash;the frank, lively, American girl, all expansive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>ness,
and without secret comers in her heart or secret
thoughts in her mind. But every now and then she was
dragged down into that soft, sentimental whirlpool. If
they passed before the English library of the Dorf, where
they had met the first time; if once again they crossed
the wood of CharnadÃ¼ras where, a trifle jestingly, they
had spoken the first words of love; if they renewed the
walk round the lake where one day he had expressed
more vigorously and ardently the fascination by which
she subdued him; if for a moment they gazed into the
dark but limpid night from the balconies of the
"Palace," with its memories of other nocturnal contemplations;
if on the return from the Maloja they
noticed from the carriage the sunset girdle with its veils
Crestalta and Villa Story; if they saw again a turn of the
road, a corner of a room&mdash;the slow whirlpool of amorous
sadness engulfed them both. They mourned for the
Engadine which they would shortly leave, they even
mourned for her when jesting and smiling at St. Moritz
Dorf station, whence they left together, and where the
departure of Mrs. Clarke and her daughter caused a
bustle, anxiety, and despair in all; where all the friends
and acquaintances had come to provide them with a
triumphal departure, with cheers and good wishes&mdash;they
mourned for the Engadine although they were
going towards their happiness. While the train entered
the tunnel opposite the foaming white cascade of the Inn,
Mabel Clarke extricated herself from the slow mental
whirlpool, and said to Vittorio Lante:</p>

<p>"We shall never love each other in another land as
we have in the Engadine."</p>

<p>"In Italy," he replied, serene and confident.</p>

<p>"Ah, in Italy," she murmured, a little drearily.</p>

<p>Lilian Temple and Lucio Sabini had prolonged their
stay in the Engadine through all that charming first
week of September, which had rendered the beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the country more intense and penetrating. As by an
enchantment it had held them bound, in forgetfulness of
all other surroundings.</p>

<p>Every day the peace and silence increased around
them, and on them the enchantment worked more profoundly.
When Lilian timidly spoke of their departure
she saw Lucio's face disturbed with mortal sadness. She
became silent, and remained yet a day, and again
another; while Miss Ford waited, calm and patient. At
last, one day, the 6th of September, Lucio asked permission
to accompany the two ladies on a visit they proposed
making, after leaving the Engadine, to Berne, to
old Berne, the historical, true Swiss city, whither go
neither worldlings nor snobs, but where it is possible to
pass two or three days of tranquillity in touch with an
ancient world of art and poesy. He asked hesitatingly,
trembling at the fear of a refusal, to be allowed to
accompany them still further, to Basle, where they
wished to stop again, to grey Basle, where Hans Holbein
left his best pictures, and where Nietzsche taught
philosophy. And nothing had been more torturing for
him than the moment in which he waited for the reply
of the two ladies, although the reply came rapid, frank,
decisive, and affectionate, filling him with joy which he
knew not how to conceal, which he read in Lilian's eyes
and smile, like his own. So from that land where they
had arrived from different countries and directions, with
different souls and hearts, from that land where destiny
had strangely brought them together, with hand clasped
in hand they left together, as if they were to journey thus
all their lives. Now and then Lilian's eyes were fixed on
the horizon of mountains towering towards the sky, but
they seemed to see nothing, being absorbed by their interior
vision; Lucio Sabini saw nothing except the dear
face and dear person of Lilian beside him, and only a
confused regret in the depth of their hearts, just a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
gnawing sorrow possessed them on the morning they left
with Miss May Ford for Berne.</p>

<p>On the morning of departure it was already calmer at
the station, because the crowd had now fled in every
direction, by every line, because silence reigned in the
valleys and in the two little villages of St. Moritz; because
only those remained who were allowing themselves
some days of calm and comfort before leaving for the
large, stifling, noisy cities. Silently, and a little pale,
Lilian followed with quiet steps her two travelling companions,
who were busy with the details of departure.
She was wearing a thick white veil, and as on the evening
of the dance at the "Kulm," she had in her hand three
white roses which Lucio had given her as a souvenir. Silent
and pale, she got into the train and stood as she watched
to see if Lucio were following; pale and silent she sat in
a corner by a window, watching the hill of the Dorf and
the plain of the Bad below, and the beautiful lake that
unites them on its banks. Her friend and companion
seated herself in another corner, and opened a large
English newspaper, while Lucio silently settled the
luggage. With a feeble whistling the train departed and
entered the tunnel along the gloomy gorge of the Inn;
but Lilian still kept her head turned to the window,
a little bowed. Uncertain and embarrassed by the
presence of May Ford, Lucio had not dared to approach
Lilian; but at last, unable to resist, he drew near to her,
calling her twice, and touching her hand and the roses,
and then he perceived that the roses were bedewed with
tears. He bent towards her ear and said in a firm voice:</p>

<p>"Lilian, you mustn't cry; you mustn't suffer."</p>

<p>Simply and courageously she ceased to weep, smiled a
moment, and replied:</p>

<p>"That is true. I mustn't cry and I mustn't suffer."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>In the rather gloomy ante-chamber, papered as it was in
old green myrtle, and austerely furnished in dark carved
wood, the electric light was lit, but shaded by a milky,
opaque globe. Francesco, the valet, silent, discreet, correct
as usual, helped his master, Lucio Sabini, to take off
his coat and freed him of hat, stick, and gloves. Lucio
entered with a more than ever tired and bored appearance,
with a pale and contracted face. In a quick,
colourless voice he asked:</p>

<p>"Are there any letters?"</p>

<p>"One; I put it on the small table."</p>

<p>Lucio Sabini experienced a fleeting hesitation before
he entered his own apartment, which was a vast room
where the shade of dusk was spreading from three broad
windows, two of which looked out on the Lungarno
Serristori and the third on to a little square, so that the
dark red, green, and maroon of the roomy, deep furniture&mdash;arm-chairs
and sofas in English leather&mdash;merged into
the single tint of shadow, and mixed with the mahogany,
with an occasional gilt fillet, of the large bookcases and
big and little tables. Here and there only the whiteness
of a china vase, the gleam of a silver figure, the brightness
of a statue of Signa's were to be distinguished. But
in spite of the gloom which the dying day at the end of
February caused in the room, the oblong envelope of the
letter shone clearly.</p>

<p>Slowly he advanced amongst the furniture, making for
a large arm-chair behind the writing-table, without lifting
his eyes from the whiteness of the letter. He threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
himself into the chair, overcome, holding the letter before
him without touching it&mdash;and some minutes passed thus.
Suddenly he gave a start, sat up in his chair, put his hand
on a switch, and the electric light was lit in three or four
large lamps. Without touching it he saw that which he
had guessed in the half-light, Lilian Temple's writing and
the envelope without a stamp.</p>

<p>"She is here ... she is here&mdash;&mdash;" he stammered,
growing very pale, and speaking aloud.</p>

<p>His twitching hands touched the letter, but still without
opening it: beneath the envelope he found a long,
narrow visiting-card. The card said: "<em>Miss May
Ford</em>," and in fine handwriting in pencil: "Will return."
He let his head sink on the arm of the chair as
he held the card in his fingers, which almost let it fall,
and lapsed into thought for some moments in the silence
of the room. Mechanically he rang the bell and started
on seeing Francesco almost immediately before him on
the other side of the desk.</p>

<p>"This letter was brought by hand, wasn't it?" he
murmured, looking at the servant as if he saw him not.</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency. It was left with the visiting-card."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By a lady, Excellency."</p>

<p>"A lady ... was she young?"</p>

<p>"No, Excellency."</p>

<p>"Was she alone?"</p>

<p>"Alone, Excellency."</p>

<p>"At what time?"</p>

<p>"At four o'clock."</p>

<p>"And what did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"That your Excellency usually returned about half-past
six and nearly always went out about eight to
dinner."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>With a gesture he dismissed the man. Scarcely was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
gone when Lucio rose, a prey to a vain agitation; he
went up and down the room as if seeking something he
found not, but without really looking for it; he gazed
around with dazed eyes, as if to question the farthest
corners of the vast room, he stumbled against some piece
of furniture without being aware of it, and touched two
or three objects without seeing them, replacing them
where he had found them. Inevitably he returned to his
writing-table, his glance settled on the closed envelope
without the stamp, over which spread Lilian Temple's
large, flexible handwriting.</p>

<p>"She is here ... she is here&mdash;&mdash;" he exclaimed
desperately. Twice he took the letter, turned it over,
made as if to open it with a rapid, despairing gesture;
the second time he threw it down on the table as if it
burnt him. He passed into the adjacent room, his bedroom,
and turned on the light. The room seemed rather
gay with its bright and fresh-coloured Liberty silk, bright
brass bed, fine lace curtains and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partiÃ¨res</i>, and the lacquered
wood of soft grey. He made for a small desk,
opened its largest drawer and drew it forth. It was full
of Lilian Temple's letters, written on fine sheets of
foreign paper, very voluminous in character, which were
crossed horizontally and vertically. Beneath them a
large envelope was hidden where surely would be a portrait,
or perhaps several portraits, of Lilian Temple; but
quite in the front of the drawer there was a large bundle
of unopened letters, like the one he had left on his
writing-table in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">salotto</i>. With a slightly trembling
hand he pushed back all the leaves which were issuing in
confusion from their opened envelopes and passed them
to the back, hiding especially the large wrapper with the
photograph, from which he averted his eyes. He
separated all the unopened letters, and counted them
twice, as if he thought that he was mistaken. There were
fourteen. Fourteen letters from Lilian Temple which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
had not opened: he looked at the one which seemed the
oldest in date, and he seemed to read on the English
stamp the date of the 26th of December. In three
months Lilian had written him fourteen letters which he
had not read, because he had not opened them; and the
last ones he had thrown away so rapidly without looking
at them that he had not even the stamp or date of departure.
For some moments he stood by the open drawer.
An agonising uncertainty was to be read on his face:
two or three times he made as if to take the closed packet
of letters and open one, or some, or all of them; but two
or three times he hesitated and repented. At last he
shrugged his shoulders roughly, pushed back the drawer
and closed it. A dull noise at his shoulder made him turn
round:</p>

<p>"Miss Ford is asking from the 'Savoy' if Signor
Lucio Sabini has returned, and if he can receive her at
once," demanded Francesco.</p>

<p>"Did you reply that I had returned?" asked Lucio,
biting his lips a little.</p>

<p>"I replied that your Excellency had returned," said
Francesco, "but nothing else."</p>

<p>"Say that I am expecting Miss Ford at once."</p>

<p>Dazed, he passed a hand over his forehead, as if wishing
to resume the direction of his tumultuous thoughts:
he strove to impress there an energy that should arouse
his lost will. But his thoughts and will lost themselves
in great tumult and disorder around this idea, these
words:</p>

<p>"If <em>she</em> were to come too; if <em>she</em> were to come with
her."</p>

<p>Like an automaton he passed again into his room.
With a rapid gesture he hid the unopened letter, the
fifteenth, the last from Florence. He moved some chairs
to occupy his hands; for a moment he leant with his
burning forehead against the glass of his bookcase, hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
his face. But the sound of the bell in the anteroom
startled him from his abandonment.</p>

<p>He jumped up, composed and tranquil, advanced to
the door, and bowed deeply to Miss May Ford, who
entered, announced by Francesco. Kissing the grey-gloved
hand which the Englishwoman extended to him,
he led her to a chair and sat down opposite her, turning
his shoulders to the large lamp on the writing-table so as
not to show his face. Dressed in grey with a black hat,
Miss May Ford showed an imperturbable face, whence
had escaped every expression of the amiability of a
former time&mdash;a tranquil, cold, imperturbable face.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Florence, Miss Ford."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Signor Sabini? Are you quite
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;thanks."</p>

<p>"Have you been keeping well?"</p>

<p>"No," he murmured, "I have been indisposed for
some time, for a month."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," exclaimed Miss Ford, with a conventional
intonation of regret. "I hope you are all right now."</p>

<p>"I am all right now, thanks," replied Lucio coldly,
perceiving that she did not believe him.</p>

<p>They exchanged a rapid glance. He was the first,
with an effort of will, to question her:</p>

<p>"Are you alone, Miss Ford?"</p>

<p>"How alone?" she asked, pretending not to understand.</p>

<p>"Isn't your travelling companion with you?" he
asked, with difficulty suppressing his emotion.</p>

<p>"She is not with me," she replied coldly.</p>

<p>"Isn't she in Florence?" he asked again, unable this
time to conceal his anxiety.</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Ford hesitated. Then she replied
again:</p>

<p>"She is not in Florence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, with a deep sigh, "and where
is she?"</p>

<p>Miss Ford scrutinised him with a long glance: then
she said:</p>

<p>"Don't <em>you</em> know where Lilian Temple is?"</p>

<p>Beneath that glance, and at those words, he was lost
and showed his loss. He stammered:</p>

<p>"I don't know: how could I know?"</p>

<p>"But you ought to know," added Miss Ford, looking
at him.</p>

<p>"That is true; perhaps I ought to know," he replied,
without understanding what she said.</p>

<p>"In her letters she always told you what she was
doing, and where she was going," added the old maid, in
a firm, precise tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, throwing her a desperate glance.</p>

<p>Miss Ford lowered her face behind her black veil and
became silent, as if she were gathering together her
ideas. Confronted with her, silent and convulsed, Lucio
Sabini waited for her words, incapable of saying anything
unless he were asked. Then she asked him calmly,
with cold courtesy:</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to answer a few of my questions,
Signor Sabini?"</p>

<p>He looked at her; and his eyes, the eyes of a man who
had lived, enjoyed, and suffered much, almost besought
her to have mercy. She averted hers naturally and
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you remember that you left us, Signor Sabini, on
the 20th of September? Do you remember that you
told Lilian&mdash;the last words on the companion-way of the
steamer as you were leaving&mdash;that you expected her
soon, as soon as possible, in Italy?"</p>

<p>What anguish there was in the man's eyes which were
fixed pleadingly on the woman, as if to beseech her to
spare him that cup; what anguish as he bowed assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The Englishwoman continued coldly: "Afterwards
she wrote to you very often from England. You replied
promptly and often in long letters. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"It is so," he answered, in a weak voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know Lilian's letters or yours. I know that
you always wrote that you wished to see her again, that
you would come to England or that she should come to
Italy. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"It is true," the man consented, weakly.</p>

<p>There was an instant of silence.</p>

<p>"Later," resumed Miss Ford, "you began to reply
less frequently, and more curtly. At last you spoke no
more of your journey to England nor of Lilian's to Italy."</p>

<p>"I spoke no more of it," he consented, with bowed
head.</p>

<p>"Finally you ceased to write to Lilian. It is three
months since you have written to her."</p>

<p>"It is three months," he said, like a sorrowful echo.</p>

<p>Miss May Ford made her inquiry with perfect composure
and courtesy, without any expression manifesting
itself on her face, without any expression passing into
her voice. Only she kept her eyes on those of Lucio's,
her limpid, proud English eyes, which spoke truth of soul
and sought it in the sad, furtive eyes of Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>"Then," resumed the Englishwoman, "as my young
friend had no reply to her letters, and as I was here in
Florence, she begged me to come and find you and to
ask you for this reply."</p>

<p>"Have you come on purpose?" he asked disconsolately.
"Did you make the journey on purpose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" replied Miss Ford at once, punctiliously.
"Not on purpose! I am here for my pleasure, and my
friend sent me to you for an answer."</p>

<p>"But what answer? Whatever answer can I give
Lilian Temple, Miss Ford?" the man cried, in great
agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. You ought to know, Signor Sabini,"
she replied boldly. "An answer, I suppose, to her last
letter."</p>

<p>"Which last letter? Which?"</p>

<p>"That of to-day: that which I brought you," concluded
Miss Ford simply.</p>

<p>He leant forward for a moment in his chair, then fell
back suddenly, overcome. And the sad confession
escaped almost involuntarily from his lips:</p>

<p>"I haven't read it."</p>

<p>"You haven't read it, Signor Sabini?" asked Miss
Ford, with her first, fleeting frown.</p>

<p>"I haven't read it," he again affirmed, with bowed
head.</p>

<p>"Oh!" only exclaimed Miss Ford, in a tone of marvel
and incredulity.</p>

<p>Lucio rose; with trembling hands he sought in his
writing-table, took the closed letter and showed it to the
Englishwoman.</p>

<p>"Here it is, untouched. I haven't read it; I haven't
opened it."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked May Ford coldly.</p>

<p>"Through fear, through cowardice," exclaimed Lucio
Sabini crudely.</p>

<p>Miss Ford was silent, with lowered eyes; her gloved
hands grasped the handle of her umbrella. And Lucio,
deciding to stretch, with his cruel hands, the wound from
which his soul was bleeding, continued:</p>

<p>"Through fear and cowardice I did not open this letter
to-day from Lilian Temple, as I have not done for nearly
three months&mdash;please understand me&mdash;I have opened
none. You do not believe me? It is not credible? I
will fetch her letters."</p>

<p>Convulsively he vanished into the other room and
reappeared immediately with the fourteen sealed letters
and threw them into Miss Ford's lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"There they are. They are all I have received since
December: I haven't read them, I tell you, nor opened
them. It is abominable, but it is so; it is grotesque,
but it is so! I am a man, I am thirty-five, I have seen
death, I have challenged death, but I have never dared
for three months to open a letter from Lilian. I have no
longer had the courage. In fact, the abominable cruelty
in not reading what she wrote me, the infamy and grotesqueness
of not opening the envelopes, the ignoring of
which I believed myself incapable, the cruelty for which
I hate and despise myself, I have done through fear and
cowardice and through nothing else. Do you understand
me?"</p>

<p>Slowly Miss Ford took the letters, one by one, read
their addresses, and placed them one on the other in
order. Raising her head, she asked, with great, even
greater coldness:</p>

<p>"Fear? Cowardice?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Through fear of the suffering caused to
myself and others, through not wishing to suffer or
know suffering, or see, or measure the sufferings of
others."</p>

<p>"Suffering? Sorrow?" again asked the cold voice
of the Englishwoman.</p>

<p>"I suffer like one of the damned, Miss Ford," he
added gloomily.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, with colourless intonation.</p>

<p>"And Lilian also suffers! Isn't it true that she
suffers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe she suffers," exclaimed Miss Ford,
glacially.</p>

<p>By now she had made a pile of the fourteen sealed
letters, and raising her head she said to Lucio Sabini:</p>

<p>"Must I take back all these letters, then, to my
friend, so that she may see and understand, Signor
Sabini? Give me the last as well and I will go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>And she made as if to rise and depart with her pile of
letters, without further remark.</p>

<p>"Then Lilian is here?" cried Lucio Sabini, drawing
near to the English lady, again convulsed. "She is here.
Tell me that she is here."</p>

<p>Miss Ford hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"No, Lilian is not here," she affirmed tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Ah, if only she were here, if only she were here!"
he cried, hiding his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Would you look for her, Signor Sabini? Would you
see her? Would you speak with her?"</p>

<p>As one in a dream he looked at the Englishwoman:
and at each question his face, contracted by his interior
anguish, seemed discomposed.</p>

<p>"No," he replied in a slow, desolate voice. "No, I
would not seek her out; I would not see her; I would
not speak with her."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"I must never see Lilian Temple again," he added,
opening his arms desolately.</p>

<p>"Never again, Signor Sabini?"</p>

<p>"Never again."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>He made a despairing but resolute movement.</p>

<p>"I am not free, Miss Ford."</p>

<p>"You have a wife?" and the Englishwoman's voice
seemed slightly ironical.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't a wife; but I am even more tied and
bound than if I had one."</p>

<p>"I don't know; I don't understand," she said.</p>

<p>"One sometimes leaves and deserts a wife. A lover
is much more difficult. Sometimes it is impossible. It
is impossible for me: I am a slave for ever."</p>

<p>He spoke harshly and brutally; but as if he were
using such harshness and brutality against himself. In
the light dimmed by the shades, it seemed as if a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
blush had spread over Miss Ford's pale face. The glaciality
of her voice diminished: it seemed crossed by a
subtle current of emotion, where also there was embarrassment,
stubbornness, and pain. Miss May's questions
were slower and more timid, more hesitating in some
words, more broken with short silences, as if she had
scarcely resumed the interrogation. Lucio's replies were
precise, rough, gloomy, as if directed to a mysterious
inquisitor of his soul, as if to his very own conscience.</p>

<p>"Isn't this person, this woman, free?"</p>

<p>"She is another's wife. Together we have betrayed
a man's confidence."</p>

<p>"Do you adore this woman?"</p>

<p>"I adored her ten years ago. Now I adore her no
more; but I am hers for ever."</p>

<p>"Then you love her very much?"</p>

<p>"I loved her with an ardent love. Now I no longer
love her; but I am her slave."</p>

<p>"Does she love you?"</p>

<p>"She did adore and love me; but now no longer.
Though without me she could not live."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I am sure. Beatrice Herz would prefer death to
being deserted."</p>

<p>"But why?" exclaimed the Englishwoman, moved
at last.</p>

<p>"Because we committed the sin of adultery."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, blushing furiously, and with
a gesture that asked to be told no more.</p>

<p>"Ah, I beg your pardon, Miss Ford," exclaimed Lucio
with a new exaltation, "I beg your pardon, if I offend
your chastity and scandalise your modesty. But since
you are here, Miss Ford, and since I shall not see you
again, or again have before me a good, upright soul like
yours, and since you will never again see the wretch before
you, let me tell you, in the bitterest, most terrible words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
all my horrible misery! Miss May, God is right, religion is
right; one must not commit adultery. He who commits
this fascinating sin pollutes his life indelibly, destroys
his happiness, sows ashes in his heart, and gathers the
fruits of the Dead Sea and poison. One must not commit
adultery. Ten years ago Beatrice Herz was so beautiful:
I was so passionate! The intoxication that joined us
and exalted was so incomparable! Ah, don't draw back,
I beg of you; listen to me to the end. I don't wish to
exalt error, but blame it; I wish not to raise up sin, but
vilify it; I do not wish to tell to myself, now too late,
what an abomination was that fraud, what a shame that
betrayal; I only wish to cry out to others, unconscious,
trusting blindly in themselves, what a death in love,
what a death in life is adultery. We loved each other for
a year, Beatrice and I; but for this year we threw away
our youth, our happiness, our liberty. A year of sin,
Signorina, is a year of servitude, of misery, of shame.
Ah, I have never so much cursed and execrated my sin
as when Lilian Temple appeared to me."</p>

<p>May Ford trembled, and started: her attention seemed
more intense.</p>

<p>"Lilian! Lilian!" he exclaimed, rising, as if in a
vision, as if holding out his arms to a phantom; "a
creature of twenty, of rare beauty, all delicacy and
grace; a loyal heart, proud and sweet, like a precious
treasure opened for me; a loving, pure soul, a flower of
freshness and virginity. Purity and candour, love and
ardour together&mdash;Lilian! Lilian! To me this creature
came full of every fascination; to me she came with her
eyes that in their blueness opened to me the way of
heaven, with her lips that smiled at me and called me,
with hands that were stretched out to me laden with
every gift, her beautiful hands that wished to give me
everything, even the very hands themselves; to walk
with her for ever, step by step, until death. Lilian!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Lilian! You who came to me to be mine, you who were
given to me by God, you who were mine&mdash;Lilian....
And I believed that I could deserve you, that I could
have you; Lilian, whom I gathered that you might be
my bride, my companion, my good&mdash;so I believed."</p>

<p>Like a child, Lucio Sabini threw himself on a sofa, his
head buried in his arms, as he wept and sighed.</p>

<p>Miss May Ford rose and went to him, but without
bending or touching him, she said anxiously:</p>

<p>"Why are you crying?"</p>

<p>He jumped up and raised his head, showing a face
convulsed with grief and furrowed by tears.</p>

<p>"I weep because I have been deceived, because I am
profoundly disillusioned; because I deceived an innocent
girl, because I lied to myself, in suddenly believing
myself free to love and be loved; because I erred, believing
that there was still time to live, to live again&mdash;while
it was too late."</p>

<p>"Too late?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sin has devastated me; sin has reduced me
to slavery. I am not worthy of freedom, of love&mdash;of
Lilian."</p>

<p>"And what must <em>dear</em> Lilian do?" And at the adjective
Miss Ford's voice trembled for an instant.</p>

<p>"She must forget me. She must! Tell her that I am
too old for her at twenty; that I am as arid as pumice-stone;
that I have neither youth, nor health, nor
strength, nor joy to offer her beauty, her fascination,
and her goodness; that I am no longer capable of love,
or enthusiasm, or fidelity, or devotion. Tell her all that!
She must forget me&mdash;she must. I am a ruined, devastated,
dead being; nothing could arouse me. Tell her
that! Let her forget me; let her forget the man who
is undeserving of her, who has never deserved her; let
her forget the being who has scorched his existence at
every flame; let her forget the man who has neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
faith, nor courage, nor hope&mdash;let her forget me. Tell her
who I am and what I am. Tell her even worse things,
that she may forget me."</p>

<p>"She will not believe me," replied Miss Ford slowly.
"Thus she did not know you in the Engadine."</p>

<p>"The man of the Engadine was a phantom," again
cried Lucio excitedly. "He was a phantom, another
myself, Miss May; another&mdash;he of ten years ago&mdash;of
once upon a time, a phantom that felt itself born again,
living again, having form and substance, blood and
nerves, being full of immense hope and certainty. In
that wondrous land, and beside a wondrous creature, in
the presence of an indescribable beauty of things and
the perfect beauty of a girl, amidst the flatteries of light,
and air, and flowers, of the fragrance, glances, and smiles
of a dear lady, that phantom had to become a man again,
had to be the man of formerly, strong in sentiment,
strong in desire, strong in the new reason for his life.
He had to be; he had to be! Who would not have cancelled
ten years of sin and slavery in an hour, in a minute,
up there amidst everything lofty and pure, white and
proud, beside a soul so pure and ardent as Lilian's?
Who would not have been another being? Who would
not have honestly believed he was another being? She
knew a phantom&mdash;tell her that! He has vanished, with
every false, fleeting form of life, with all his hopes and
desires. The wretched phantom vanished in a moment."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"On the pier at Ostend, while your boat, as it cleaved
the mist, bore you back to England."</p>

<p>Exhausted, frightened, he fell back on the sofa, and
scarcely breathed. Standing silently and thoughtfully,
Miss May Ford seemed to be waiting for the last words.
He raised his head. The tears were dried on his flushed
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Tell her to forget me," he resumed in a hard voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
"to fall in love with someone as young as she is, with an
honest young Englishman, sane of spirit as she is; with
a young Englishman, loving and pure as she is. Let her
fall in love with this Englishman, and marry him."</p>

<p>"I do not know if she can do that, Signor Sabini."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that she will not succeed in forgetting
me?" he asked, again in anguish.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she replied, shaking her head. "I
do not know all the depths of her heart."</p>

<p>"Do you think she loves me very much? That she
loves me too much?" he asked with emotion, taking
her hands.</p>

<p>"I am ignorant as to how much she loves you. She
has not told me. We don't discuss these things in England,"
added Miss Ford quickly.</p>

<p>"Six weeks together," he murmured thoughtfully,
"only six weeks, and a girl of twenty. It is impossible
for her to be too much in love with me."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so, if only we may hope so," replied
Miss Ford.</p>

<p>"I hope so, I believe it; it must be so. Lilian must
be loved by another; she must be happy with another,
and forget her shadow of love in the Engadine, her
phantom of the Engadine."</p>

<p>The colloquy was ended. The last words came from
the lips of the quiet, good Englishwoman.</p>

<p>"Won't you now content my friend, Signor Sabini?
Won't you give me a reply to her letter? To the letter
I brought you to-day?"</p>

<p>Uncertainly and anxiously he took the letter which
remained abandoned on the writing-table. With a
rapid movement he tore open the envelope. It contained
the following few words in English:</p>

<p>"My love; tell me if you ever loved me, if you still
love me. I shall always love you.&mdash;L<small>ILIAN</small>."</p>

<p>Lucio read aloud the few simple, frank words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
tender question, the deep promise. And all the amorous
life of the Engadine reappeared to him, in all its most
intimate and invincible attraction. His whole soul reeled,
his heart broke.</p>

<p>"Tell her how much I loved her, Miss May; tell her
how much I still love her; that far-away and all the
time I shall always be hers. Tell her that; it is the
truth. I have never deceived her. That is the answer,
the only answer."</p>

<p>Thus he besought May Ford, with anxious eyes and
trembling lips, in a cry that arose from the innermost
depths of his heart, that the cry might reach even to Lilian.</p>

<p>"I can't tell her that," replied Miss Ford gravely, "I
will not tell her that."</p>

<p>"But why not; if it be the truth? Why not?"</p>

<p>"If I tell her, Signor Sabini, she can never forget you,
she will never cease to love you. She must never know
that you love her."</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed!" he replied sadly, "and how could
she ever understand, she who is innocent, simple, and
pure, that I can love her and yet fly from her; that I can
love her and remain with Beatrice Herz? That is my inexorable
condemnation&mdash;Lilian can never understand."</p>

<p>"Signor Sabini, tell me the only thing necessary for
her to forget; something short and convincing that can
turn Lilian."</p>

<p>Miss Ford sighed, as if she had talked too much and
expressed too much.</p>

<p>"One thing only, then," said Lucio Sabini firmly.
"You shall tell her simply that a woman has been mine
for ten years, that she has loved me very much, and keeps
me as if it were her life itself, and that if I left her she
would die. I remain with her so that she may not die."</p>

<p>"Must I say that she would die?"</p>

<p>"You must say that. If Lucio Sabini were to desert
Beatrice Herz she would kill herself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"She would kill herself; very good."</p>

<p>Bowing composedly to Lucio, Miss May Ford turned
her back and left with calm steps.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following day Lucio Sabini hovered round the
precincts of the Savoy Hotel like a child, turning his
back if he saw a carriage leaving or arriving, disappearing
into a shop if he saw the omnibus full of travellers
leaving, vanishing into an adjacent street whenever he
saw a lady or two ladies leaving or entering. He did not
see Miss May Ford either leave or enter at any time, and
he dared not enter the vestibule of the hotel to ask if she
had left, or were leaving soon. He ended by withdrawing,
and almost flying from the neighbourhood of the
hotel, where his soul indicated to him the presence of
Lilian Temple. In the tepid, odoriferous hour of sunset,
he went to the Cascine, drove, as every day, to the Viale
Michelangelo, and at every carriage he met, in which
from afar he seemed to perceive two ladies, he trembled,
jumped up, and was about to tell his coachman to turn
round. Those who greeted him in that sunset were not
recognised by him; she for whom he had sacrificed
Lilian Temple waited for him in vain towards half-past
six, for the very short daily visit which he paid her to
take the orders for the evening. At nine in the evening
he was beneath the portico of the Florence railway
station, hidden behind the farthest of the columns which
support it, watching the arrival of the travellers'
carriages and hotel omnibuses for the departure of the
express to Bologna and Milan in connection with the
Gothard train for France. It still wanted three-quarters
of an hour; every five minutes he drew out his watch
nervously. His eyes watched, in the obscurity, the
corner of Santa Maria Novella, whence the carriages
and omnibuses reach the station; at some moments his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
impatience had no bounds. However, he kept himself
closely hidden behind the pillar with the collar of his
overcoat raised, as if he were cold, and with the rim of
his black hat lowered over his eyes; only his eyes lived
ardently within him, through his scorched soul, which
waited, invoked, and knew that Lilian was about to
appear. Twice Miss Ford had denied Lilian's presence
in Florence, but, like all Englishwomen who know not
how to tell a lie, she had hesitated for a moment before
pronouncing the lie. All Lucio's mind palpitated with
the anxiety of waiting behind the pillar, because he was
now sure that Lilian Temple would appear from one
moment to another. Suddenly he felt himself wrapped
in a double impetus of joy and sorrow, because Lilian
Temple with Miss Ford had descended at fifty paces distance
from him, from the omnibus of the Savoy Hotel.
Seeing her, recognising and watching her, he heard a
voice within him, speaking in his ear, as if a living being
were speaking beside him, so much so that, frightened,
he turned round as he heard the words, to seek whomsoever
could have uttered them:</p>

<p>"Lilian loves you; you love her. Take her in your
arms, and fly with her."</p>

<p>Step for step Lilian followed her friend and guardian,
May Ford, who was seeing to the details of departure,
while they exchanged neither a word nor a nod. From
his hiding-place behind the pillar, Lucio saw Lilian's
slender, fine figure outlined in her black travelling-dress,
that he knew so well, the travelling-dress she had worn
when they left the Engadine together for Berne and
Basle. From his hiding-place he saw Lilian's blond head
beneath her black hat with the white feather; but,
owing to the distance, and the thick white veil she wore,
as on that other journey when they left the Engadine, he
could hardly make out her face. But neither in her
hands nor at her waist was she carrying flowers as then:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
her hands weakly held a little travelling valise and a
slender umbrella. But she had no flowers. Seeing this,
Lucio heard, like a whisper in his ears, the voice again
telling him:</p>

<p>"She is leaving; go with her."</p>

<p>The two English ladies now entered the long, narrow
vestibule of the station, covered with glass, and disappeared
from Lucio's eyes. He withdrew from the pillar,
and began to follow them from a distance, as side by
side, and without speaking, they went through the vestibule.
From the distance it seemed to Lucio that now
and then Lilian bowed her head on her breast; but he
could not observe very well, owing to the crowd that
came between them. Miss Ford bought a book and a
paper from the bookstall; she was lost for a few moments
as she chose them, while Lilian waited at a little distance,
her face almost invisible behind her white veil, as
she leaned with both her hands on the handle of her
umbrella, as if she were tired. The ladies withdrew
towards the first-class waiting-room; Lucio followed
them, keeping his distance. They did not sit down, and
he kept behind the glass door, as he peeped inside. Lilian
Temple's deep silence, even if she liked silence, even if
the two companions were gladly silent, overwhelmed him,
as being the sign of something mysterious that kept her
closed within herself, since she was now incapable of
telling anything of what she felt to anyone.</p>

<p>The two ladies noticing the opening of the doors for
departure, went out on to the platform, and proceeded to
the train, which was to take them to Milan, and thence to
Chiasso, France, and England. When Lucio Sabini saw
that the train was about to start, and that the two ladies
were looking for their places from carriage to carriage,
quietly and with determination, to leave and vanish
from him; when he understood that in a few minutes
the dear young face would disappear in the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the night, without her having seen him again, without
his farewell; when he understood that she was going
from him, spurned, refused, almost driven away by him,
he trembled with sorrow, and almost with fear, for once
again someone seemed to be speaking in his ear, but with
an even more intense and mysterious voice:</p>

<p>"Don't let her leave alone; go with her."</p>

<p>Constrained by this sorrow, by the fear which the interior
voice was inflicting on him, he hurried his steps,
and almost ran to reach the two ladies. But a flow of
people crossed his path; trucks full of luggage intervened.
When he succeeded in surmounting the obstacles
the two English ladies were already in their carriage. He
halted at a little distance, where they could not see him,
and observed that Lilian Temple was already seated
behind the window. She was silent. She did not look
at the bustle of the station, she gazed at nothing, she
sought and expected no one. At last, beneath the great
electric light, Lucio almost distinguished her face beneath
the white veil. It was a composed face, with
drooping eyes, but tearless, and perhaps without any
expression of sadness; a closed mouth, without smiles,
but firm and calm in its lines. A great chill froze Lucio's
heart, and rooted him to the spot, as he thought:</p>

<p>"She does not suffer; she is resigned and tranquil."</p>

<p>He remained motionless as the doors were banged to
and closed violently, while the orders for departure were
transmitted briskly, and the locomotive whistled. Without
stirring, he watched the train move, the carriage
draw away where Lilian Temple sat, and the beloved
face disappear behind the white veil. Then, in the suddenly
empty station, when he was left alone, an immense
bitterness invaded him, and bitterly he thought:</p>

<p>"She will forget me."</p>

<p>That other true voice of his conscience was silent and
overcome.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>All the morning, as every day, the bell of the entrance
door of Vittorio Lante's pretty but modest apartments
in Via de' Prefetti had done nothing but ring: and his
housekeeper, his only servant, an old woman of very
honest appearance, who had been settled with him by his
mother, had done nothing but announce to her master
the visits of the most diverse and strange people. This
pilgrimage of friends, acquaintances, and strangers had
begun directly after Vittorio had returned from Paris, in
fact from Cherbourg, where he had accompanied his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancÃ©e</i>, Mabel Clarke, and his future mother-in-law,
Annie Clarke, whence they had embarked on a colossal
transatlantic liner. Scarcely had the newspapers
announced, rather solemnly, the arrival of the Prince of
Santalena, Don Vittorio Lante, who in the spring would
depart for America, where would be celebrated, with
marvellous sumptuousness, his marriage with Miss Mabel
Clarke, than those apartments, usually calm and silent,
had been invaded every day by people of all conditions
and kinds. In December Don Vittorio Lante della
Scala, whom everyone now complacently called the
Prince of Santalena, although he had not yet been able to
repurchase, shall we say, the right to bear this title, had
gone to Terni to pass the feasts of Christmas and the New
Year with his mother, Donna Maria Lante della Scala,
who lived in great retirement in a few rooms of the
majestic Palazzo Lante, and he did not return until the
middle of January.</p>

<p>Again the oddest people, known and unknown, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to overflow the small but elegant abode of Don
Vittorio, and as winter declined to spring, the people
arrived in increasing numbers and besieged Vittorio at
home. They waited for him at the door and went to
look for him in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parloir</i> of his club, where he lunched
and dined; they ran everywhere he was wont to
repair. Each morning and evening bundles of letters
arrived for him, some of which were registered and insured
to the value of a thousand and two thousand lire.
One day, in fact, he had a letter with a declared value
of five thousand lire. And all, intimate and ordinary
friends, old and new acquaintances, strangers and unknown,
wrote him letters, sent him enclosures, forwarded
him documents, attracted by the immense fortune he was
about to possess in marrying Mabel Clarke with a dowry
of fifty millions&mdash;and some said a hundred millions. All
desired and wished, all asked from him, with some excuse
or other, with one pretext or another, a little part, a big
part, a huge part of this fortune which was not yet his,
but which would be his within six, four, or two months.</p>

<p>One sought a loan on his return from the honeymoon,
a friendly loan, nothing else, through the ties of old
affection, giving no hint as to the date or manner of repayment;
someone asked a serious loan with splendid
guarantees and first mortgages; another wished to sell
him the four horses of his stage-coach; another wished
to give up to him his kennels, another a villa, a castle, a
palace, a property, another wished him to redeem from
the Government an island in the Tyrrhennian Sea to go
hunting there; while another wished him to acquire a
yacht of two thousand tons.</p>

<p>Every day to all this were added the visits of vendors
of jewels, of linen, of fashions for men and women, of fine
wines and liqueurs, wanting him to buy from them for
fabulous sums, offering all the credit possible, to be paid
for a year after the marriage, so that they might have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
honour of being his purveyors. To their visits and letters
were added those of other strange beings, small and great
inventors who asked much money to relinquish their
inventions; discoverers of wonderful secrets which they
would reveal for a consideration; girls who asked for a
dowry to enable them to marry; singers who asked to be
maintained at the Conservatoire for two or three years,
the time that was necessary to become rivals of Caruso;
widows with six sons who wished to lodge three or four
with him; people out of employment who would like to
follow him to America when he went to marry; other
unemployed who asked for letters of introduction to John
Clarke; adventurers who compared themselves with him
and wanted to know how he had managed to please a girl
with fifty millions; seamstresses who asked for a sewing-machine;
students who wanted him to pay their university
fees. All this was done in fantastic alternation,
sometimes honest, sometimes false, but often grotesque
and disgusting; for the saraband was conducted on a
single note&mdash;money, which it is true he had not yet, as
nearly everyone knew that he was poor, but that within
six months or less he would have an immense fortune.
In fact, some of the more cynical and shameless believed
that he already had money, as if Mabel Clarke's millions,
or million, or half a million, had already reached him as
a present from the future father and mother-in-law, or
from his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancÃ©e</i> herself. Indeed, an old mistress of a
month asked for three thousand francs which she said
would be of immediate use to her and which he could
surely give her since he had so much money from
America: in exchange she offered him some love letters
which he had written her, threatening on the other hand
to send them to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancÃ©e</i> in America. He who had
registered his letter to the value of five thousand lire sent
him a copy of a bill of exchange of his father's, of thirty
years ago, a bill which Don Giorgio Lante had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
paid; and, as usual, the correspondent threatened a
great scandal. During the first two months this strange
assault at home, at the club, in the streets, in drawing-rooms,
in fact everywhere he went, this curious assault of
avarice and greed interested and amused him. He was
supremely happy in those early days. He had taken
leave of Mabel, certain of her troth; Annie Clarke, the
silent idol, had smiled on him benevolently from the deck
of the liner, and he was sure that John Clarke would give
him his daughter. At that time he received gracious
letters&mdash;a little brief it is true&mdash;from Mabel, and still
more often cablegrams&mdash;a form she preferred&mdash;of three
or four words in English, always very affectionate: and
he replied at once. He was supremely happy!</p>

<p>The human comedy, the human farce which bustled,
not around him, but around the money he was going to
possess, was at bottom somewhat flattering. He enjoyed
all the pleasures of vanity which an enormously
rich man can have, although still poor. His nature was
simple and frank, his heart was loyal. He loved Mabel
ardently and enthusiastically; but the sense of power
which he had for a short time came pleasantly to him.
Therefore he was polite to all his morning and evening
aggressors; he refused no one a hearing; he never said
no. Only with a courteous smile he postponed to later
any decision, till after the marriage or the honeymoon.
Some sought for a bond or a promise in writing; amiably
and firmly he refused, without allowing him who was so
persistent to lose all hope. Vittorio Lante was never
impatient with all those who asked of him from fifty lire
to five hundred thousand, sometimes smiling and laughing
as he kept the most eccentric letters to laugh at them
with Mabel in America, when they should have some
moments of leisure. In these annoyances of wealth there
was a hidden pleasure, of which for some time he felt the
impressions keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a cablegram of the 3rd of December, from New
York, told him that John Clarke had consented. Intoxicated
with joy he telegraphed to Mabel, to Annie, even to
John Clarke, and left at once for Terni, to announce the
glad tidings to his noble and gentle mother. Still soon
some shadows began to spread themselves over his life;
light shadows at first and then darker. Like lightning
the news of the betrothal of the great American millionairess
with a young Roman prince had been spread
and printed everywhere in all the European newspapers,
and gradually there had begun witty and slightly pungent
comments, then rather cutting remarks. Whoever
sent the French, German, and English papers to him at
Terni, to the Palazzo Lante, which first congratulated
him ironically and afterwards, gradually complicating
the news and redoubling the echoes, treated him as a
broken noble of extinct heraldry, as a dowry-hunter, a
seller of titles; whoever sent these witty, impertinent,
often directly libellous papers had marked in red and
blue, with marks of exclamation, the more trenchant
remarks. Implacably, while he was away from Rome,
away from every great centre, in the solitude of his
ancient palace&mdash;with what sarcasm the ruin of this
palace had been described in the papers and the necessity
for restoring it with Papa Clarke's money!&mdash;he received
whole packets of these papers and in his morbid curiosity
and offended feelings he opened all, devouring them with
his eyes, and read them through, to become filled with
anger and bitterness.</p>

<p>But if a tender letter from Mabel reached him at Terni,
if she replied with a tender expression to a dispatch of
his, his anger calmed and his bitterness melted. His
mother saw him pass from one expression to another, but
she was unwilling to inquire too closely. With a tender
smile and gentle glance she asked him simply:</p>

<p>"Does Mabel still love you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Always, mamma," he replied, trembling with emotion
at the recollection of the beautiful, fresh girl.</p>

<p>But new papers arrived and again his mind was disturbed
with anger and sorrow. He would have liked
to reply to them all, with denials, with violent words,
with actions against those people of bad faith, against
the villains who had published the news, who had
printed the articles and paragraphs full of gall: he
would have liked to have picked a quarrel with the
paper, cuffed the journalist and fought a duel with him;
he wished to fight a dozen duels, make a noisy scandal,
and then reduce to silence those chroniclers of slander
and calumny by giving true light to the truth of deeds.
Then he hesitated and repented of it. He tore up the
letter he had begun and exercised over himself a pacifying
control. Was he right to reply to malignity, lies, and
insinuations? Was it not better to shrug the shoulders,
and let them talk and print, and smile at it all; laugh at
the journalists and despise the journals? Would not
Mabel Clarke, if she had been with him, have thought and
decided so, the American girl without prejudices, free in
ideas and sentiments, incapable of allowing herself to be
conquered by conventionality and social hypocrisy?
Then he repressed and controlled himself. But in the
depth of his spirit now and then arose a second reason for
silence: with increasing bitterness he told himself that
some and many of the things had the appearance of
truth, and that some of them, moreover, were true. He
loved Mabel Clarke sincerely, but it was undeniable that
it was a magnificent match for whomsoever married her,
even if he were rich, and he instead was absolutely poor.
Mabel loved him loyally, but she was the daughter of an
American merchant and he was the heir of a great name,
a descendant of a great family. Love was there, but
barter in one way or another had all the appearance of
existing, and did exist. The rest, it is true, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
malignity, insinuation, and calumny of journalists; but
the barter was undeniable, even sanctioned by ardent
sympathy. What was the use of writing, of lawsuits, of
cuffing and provoking duels? It were better to be silent
and pretend to smile and laugh; in fact, in a fury of
pretence to smile and really laugh at all papers and
journalists.</p>

<p>On reaching Rome during the first ten days of January
he was consoled by a single thought against such infamies;
that Mabel on the other side might know little
or nothing of them. Letters and telegrams continued to
be always very affectionate: the marriage ought to take
place in the middle of April, but John Clarke had been
unwilling to fix a precise date. That exalted his heart
and rendered him strong against everything that was
printed about the nuptials: gradually now the papers
became silent. But at home, where his aggressors repaired
more than ever, to ask whatever they could ask
from a man immensely rich, even they in the middle of
their discourses, would let slip a phrase or an allusion,
that they had read something and had been scandalised
by it: how could rascals on papers nowadays be allowed
to insult such a gentleman as he was&mdash;Don Vittorio
Lante, Prince of Santalena as they knew him to be?</p>

<p>At each of these allusions which wounded him, even in
the midst of the adulations and flatteries of his interlocutors,
he trembled and his face became clouded: he
noted that everyone knew them and everyone had read
them, that the calumnies had been spread broadcast in
every set. Even at the club, now and then, someone
with the most natural disingenuousness would ask him if
he had read such and such a Berlin paper; someone else,
more friendly, would tell him frankly how he had grieved
to read an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre-filet</i> of a Parisian paper. Sometimes he
would smile or jest or shrug his shoulders, and sometimes
he showed his secret anger. His well-balanced, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
courteous mood changed; sometimes he treated petitioners
badly and dismissed them brusquely. Such would
leave annoyed, murmuring on the stairs that as a matter
of fact the European papers had not been wrong to
treat Don Vittorio Lante della Scala as a very noble and
fashionable adventurer, but still an adventurer. He
passed ten restless days in which only Mabel's letters and
telegrams came to calm him a little.</p>

<p>But he experienced the deepest shock when complete
packets of American papers arrived for him, voluminous,
and all marked with red and blue pencil, since each contained
something about his engagement, his marriage,
his nobility, and his family. In long columns of small type
were spread out the most unlikely stories, most offensive
in their falseness; therein were inserted the most
vulgar and grotesque things at his expense, or at the expense
of Italy or Italians. It was a regular avalanche of
fantastic information, of extravagant news, of lying
declarations, of interviews invented purposely, of fictitious
correspondence from Rome, and in addition to all
this the most brutal comments on this capture of an
American girl and her millions by another poor European
gentleman, in order to carry away the girl and her money,
and make her unhappy, to waste her money on other
women as did all sprigs of European nobility, not only in
Italy, but wherever they had managed to ensnare an
American girl. Other marriages between rich American
women and aristocratic but poor Europeans were quoted,
with their often sad lot, conjugal separations, with their
divorces, fortunes squandered in Europe, with their souls
alienated from mother and father, and every American
paper concluded that their daughters were mad and
foolish again to attempt an experience which had always
succeeded ill with them; that this miserable vanity of
becoming the wife of an English Duke, a Hungarian
magnate, a French marquis or Italian Prince should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
suppressed. They should put it away: American women
should wed American men and not throw away their
fresh persons and abundant money on corrupt and
cynical old Europe.</p>

<p>When he had read all this, Vittorio Lante was
thoroughly unhappy. The papers were old, but there
were some recent ones; the latest, those of ten or twelve
days previously, breathed an even more poisonous
bitterness. By now he had learned to speak English
much better, and understood it perfectly; none of that
perfidy, none of that brutality escaped him, and all his
moral sensibility grieved insupportably, all his nerves
were on edge with spasms, as he thought that Mabel
Clarke, his beloved, his wife to be, had read those
infamies from America, and had absorbed all that poison.
He would have liked to telegraph her a hundred or a
thousand words, to swear to her that they were all
nauseating lies; but he repented of it and tore up the
telegram, striving to reassure himself, as he thought that
a direct and independent creature like Mabel Clarke, that
a loyal and honest friend like the American girl would
laugh at and despise the horrid things.</p>

<p>But by a mysterious coincidence, which made him
secretly throb with anguish, a week passed by without a
letter or note, or a single word by telegram, reaching him
from New York; Vittorio passed a fortnight of complete
silence between anguish and despair. Instead, a
very broad and voluminous letter, under cover and
registered, reached him from New York, containing a
long article about his indiscretions, dated from Rome, in
which it was narrated, with the most exaggerated particulars,
how Miss Mabel Clarke's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancÃ©</i> in Italy had
seduced a cousin two or three years ago, how she had
had a son by him, and how he had deserted her and her
little one in a district of Lazio. Vittorio Lante, who in
three weeks of silence had written Mabel Clarke four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
letters, and sent three telegrams without obtaining a
reply, dying with impatience and anxiety, and hiding it
from people, felt as if a dart were passing through his
heart, from side to side, felt as if all his blood were ebbing
away, and he remained exhausted and bloodless, unable
to live or die.</p>

<p>So that morning at the end of February all those whom
Giovanna, the faithful servant, gradually announced,
since her master, pale and taciturn, consented to receive
them with an automatic nod, found a man who received
them with a silent and fleeting smile, with a rare word as
he listened but scarcely replied to them, when they had
finished expounding their ideas and propositions, as if he
had understood nothing, and perhaps had heard nothing
of them. For four or five days, with a great effort of the
will, Vittorio kept up appearances, driving back his
anguish to the depths of his heart, knowing that profound
dissimulation is necessary in the world, and that the
world must see little of our joy and none of our sorrow.</p>

<p>That morning there filed before him a traveller for
a motor-car company who wished to make him buy
three cars, of forty, sixty, and eighty horse-power respectively,
to be paid for, naturally, after the marriage,
but consignable a month previously with, of course, a
fixed contract; a kind of tatterdemalion, all anointed,
who offered him a Raphael, an authentic Raphael, for
two hundred thousand lire, and who ended by asking
for two francs to get something to eat; a gentleman of
high society, who lived by the sale of old pictures,
tapestry, bronzes, and ivories, who took them from the
antiquaries and re-sold them, gaining a little or a big
commission, a friend who proposed increasing the prices,
since Mabel Clarke was to pay, and that they should both
divide the difference, proposing to him, in fact, that he
should rob his future wife; a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littÃ©rateur</i> who came to seek
from him the funds to launch a review in three languages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and who proposed to insert therein his own articles which
Vittorio Lante should sign with his name; an agent of
a bankrupt exchange, known to be unable to go on
'change, who proposed some mining affairs in Africa for
John Clarke to take up, offering him a stiff commission so
that he should transfer these uncertain shares to his
father-in-law. And, more or less, in all demands, proposals,
and requests which were made to him that morning,
he perceived the intention to mock and cheat him,
but still more he discovered in many of them the conception
that he was a man of greed, who could for more or
less money deceive his wife and father-in-law, cheat and
rob them, like a sponger or society thief. Even more
sorrowfully than at other times, he trembled when he
noticed the expression of lack of esteem in which the
people in his presence held him, people who dared in his
own house to propose crooked bargains, equivocal business,
as they offered him his own price!</p>

<p>"Am I, then, dishonoured?" he thought, with a rush
of bitterness. The morning passed and afternoon came:
he was alone, and for the third or fourth time in three or
four hours he asked Giovanna if letters or telegrams had
arrived. It was an almost convulsive demand, which he
had repeated constantly for three weeks, the only demand
that showed another human being the state of
convulsion in which he found himself. Nothing came,
nor that morning either, except the newspapers, and
a letter from Donna Maria Lante from Terni, which
Giovanna had at once consigned to him. He composed
his face, resumed the artless, jolly expression which had
been his worldly mask, went to lunch at the club, and
replied to three or four friends that the marriage would
certainly take place in April. He jested with everyone;
he held up his head before all, but he did not fail to
observe that in questions, in compliments, in congratulations,
there was a sense of hesitation, as of a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
incredulity and a little irony. The old Duke of Althan
was very cold with him; Marco Fiore scarcely greeted
him. Hurt and very nervous, he thought:</p>

<p>"Am I, then, dishonoured?"</p>

<p>He returned home: there were no letters or telegrams.
He went out again to Calori's fencing school, and passed
an hour of violent exercise, in which he allowed to escape
whatever was insupportable in his pain; again he returned
home, found nothing there, and went out to leave
cards on two or three foreign ladies, whose acquaintance
he had made the day before at a tea at the English
Ambassadress'. He wandered through Rome, and for the
third time, as if it were the way of the Cross, he repaired
home, asked Giovanna from the speaking-tube if there
were anything for him. She replied that there was a
telephone message for him. Disillusioned, more than
ever pierced by anxiety, he went upstairs, took from the
landing-place the little card on which Giovanna had
written the telephone message, and read:</p>

<p>"A friend from America expects Don Vittorio Lante
at the Grand Hotel at half-past four to take a cup of tea.
Room Number Twenty-seven."</p>

<p>Vittorio trembled from head to foot, like a tree shaken
by the wind; he drew out his watch convulsively. It
wanted ten minutes to the appointment; he hurled himself
into a cab, trembling and controlling himself, not
noticing the streets he passed, and biting his lips at every
obstacle his carriage met. On at last reaching the vestibule
of the Grand Hotel, he threw the No. 27 to the
porter. Refusing the lift, bounding up the stairs to the
first floor, he knocked at twenty-seven, while his heart
seemed to leap into his throat, suffocating him. From
within the clear, harmonious voice of Mabel Clarke said
to him in English:</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>His face changed to a mortal pallor in her presence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
as standing in the middle of the great, bright room, full of
flowers, she offered him her hand; his too intense emotion
filled his eyes with tears. He took the hand and
kissed it, while his tears fell on it.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear old boy," murmured Mabel, moved,
looking at him affectionately and smiling.</p>

<p>He held the hand between his own, looked into his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancÃ©e's</i> eyes, and the cry, so often repressed, was from
the depth of his heart:</p>

<p>"Mabel, I swear to you that I am an honest man."</p>

<p>"Do not swear, Vittorio," she replied at once, "I
know it."</p>

<p>"Ah, they calumniated me, they defamed me, they
dishonoured me. Mabel!" he exclaimed, falling into an
arm-chair, "I swear to you that they are lies, infamous
lies."</p>

<p>"I know," she replied with a softness in her firm, clear
voice, "that they are lies."</p>

<p>"Ah, my consoler, my friend, my delight," he said,
with a sigh, taking her hands, drawing her to him, and
embracing her and kissing her on her forehead, and eyes,
and cheeks.</p>

<p>She allowed herself to be embraced and kissed, but
with a gracious movement she freed herself from him,
and they sat side by side on one of the large sofas,
beneath a great Musa plant.</p>

<p>"Do you still love me, Mabel?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of you, dear," she replied tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Why have you caused me such suffering, dear, dear
Mabel, in not writing or telegraphing to me?"</p>

<p>"I was travelling to Rome," she explained.</p>

<p>"But when did you start?" he asked, already disquieted.</p>

<p>"Three weeks ago, dear."</p>

<p>"Then you have been elsewhere?" he continued,
controlling his agitation with an effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, elsewhere," she rejoined with a smile, but
without further explanation.</p>

<p>"But why didn't you warn me, dear? Why make
me pass terrible days here alone in Rome, not knowing
how to vent my anger and sorrow? Ah, what
days!"</p>

<p>"I left unexpectedly, Vittorio."</p>

<p>"Unexpectedly?"</p>

<p>"I decided to come to Rome in search of you on the
spur of the moment. Mammy is on the other side, only
Broughton accompanied me. I am incognito, dear; no
one knows that I am Mabel Clarke. I am called Miss
Broughton."</p>

<p>She laughed shortly. He was still more disturbed,
though he did not wish to show it. Confused and embarrassed,
he looked at her, finding her more blooming
than ever in her irresistible youth, in her face flourishing
with beauty and health, in her slender figure dressed in
white. Like a lover he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Nothing matters now that you are here, Mabel, now
that I am beside you, now that I press your dear hand,
where is all my happiness."</p>

<p>She listened to him as formerly, bowing her head with
its rebellious chestnut locks a little, as if the ardent
breath of those words were caressing her face and soul.
Then, suddenly, she said simply:</p>

<p>"Shall we have tea, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," he replied, enchanted with her. Just as
formerly, she went to a little table where everything was
ready to make tea. She accomplished quickly and
gracefully the little operations, while he watched her,
enchanted by that beloved presence, and by her action
and words, which reminded him of, and brought to life
again, his dream of love in the Engadine. Suddenly all
Vittorio's ecstasy dissolved; he was again disturbed by
a violent uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why have you come to Rome, Mabel?" he asked,
somewhat authoritatively.</p>

<p>"To learn the truth, Vittorio," she replied firmly,
"and to tell it to you."</p>

<p>"To learn the truth, Mabel? Then you believed the
infamies?"</p>

<p>"I did not believe them," she replied, shaking her head
seriously.</p>

<p>"Did you believe that my mother was a martyr
because of me, dying of hunger in her palace at Terni,
mending silk stockings to let me live?" he cried, beside
himself.</p>

<p>"I did not believe it. I went to Terni two days ago;
I saw your mother, and I embraced her. She's a saint,
and you are a good son."</p>

<p>"You went to Terni? Yet you say that you did not
believe it, Mabel? How dare you say so? You also
believed that I seduced Livia Lante; did you not?"</p>

<p>"I did not believe that; but I saw your cousin Livia
four days ago at Velletri. I spoke to her, and she told
me everything. You did not seduce her, and you never
promised to marry her; she is sure that you do not love
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mabel, Mabel, what shame for me! You went
to seek the proofs of my honesty; what shame for me!
You believed me a villain!" Convulsed with grief, he
hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>She arose; took his hands away from his face, and
forced him to look at her.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, don't go on so, I beg of you. I believed
nothing, but I wanted to know the truth. As for us in
our country, we believe only with our eyes, so I decided
to look for the truth."</p>

<p>"I have never lied to you, Mabel," he added, a little
more calmly.</p>

<p>"No, never; you are a brave, loyal old boy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"You continue, then, after your personal inquiry,
Mabel, to esteem and love me?"</p>

<p>"I continue to esteem and be fond of you."</p>

<p>"You continue to be mine."</p>

<p>"No," she replied clearly; "I do not continue to be
yours."</p>

<p>"Do you take back your word?" he cried, amazed.</p>

<p>"It is you who will give me back yours," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"I? I?"</p>

<p>"You, dear. Because you are a man of honour, for no
other reason, because you are a gentleman you will break
off of your own accord our engagement, and we shall not
marry."</p>

<p>Mabel spoke simply and firmly, without emotion.
Moreover, her face had a seriousness and a gravity that
he had never seen.</p>

<p>"Shall we not marry?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, Vittorio. We ought not to marry."</p>

<p>"Because of the calumnies and defamations, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"For none of those horrid things, my dear. We ought
not to marry because we should make a mistake."</p>

<p>"A mistake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a mistake, which later would make us so unhappy,
you and I. Now, we ought not to be unhappy."</p>

<p>"But why? But why?" he asked, very agitatedly.</p>

<p>"Because I am very rich and you are very poor."</p>

<p>"How horrible! How horrible!" he murmured
gloomily, despondently.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que faire, mon cher?</i>" she exclaimed in French,
shrugging her shoulders; "I have this money because
father gave it to me, and I can't throw it away: can I?
Money isn't such a bad thing. It isn't my fault if I have
so much of it."</p>

<p>"Neither is it my fault if I am so poor," he rejoined
sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor is it mine, dear Vittorio."</p>

<p>"You knew I was poor! I confessed it to you. I
hid nothing from you."</p>

<p>"That is true," she declared at once. "I knew that:
you told me loyally. I loved you and esteemed you for
your loyalty. Only I made a mistake."</p>

<p>"You made a mistake?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I made a mistake in believing that a rich
woman could marry a poor man without being very
unhappy afterwards. It is a great mistake. I beg your
pardon, Vittorio, for my mistake. You are suffering
for it, and I want you to pardon me."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you don't suffer; it doesn't matter at all to
you," he exclaimed, very bitterly.</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself, Vittorio," she added, with
some sweetness. "I suffer as I know how to, as I can.
But it is better to suffer a brief, great sorrow, than to
suffer for the whole of one's life."</p>

<p>"But why should we suffer together, Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Because of the money, dear."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that when I loved you."</p>

<p>"I know that," she replied, taking his hand and
pressing it, "but people don't. You have been seeking
for a large dowry for some years; you wanted to make
a great marriage. People in America and Italy will
never believe you to be disinterested."</p>

<p>"But you who know and love me? You should see
that I love and adore you only for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Even love wanes later, and not so very much later,"
she replied thoughtfully. "Your Italian love is so
ardent and flattering; it sets very soon. Afterwards
... I should believe people; I should believe that
you had married me for my money."</p>

<p>"<em>Afterwards!</em> I swear to you that there should be
no afterwards for me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Swear not. All American women who have married
Europeans have been disillusioned and betrayed."</p>

<p>"Others! Others!"</p>

<p>"They were also gentlemen, dear, who perhaps were
in good faith. It is useless, we are too different; we
have other souls and temperaments. We have no
luck with you Europeans, we poor, rich American
women."</p>

<p>Obstinately she shook her head; then she resumed
slowly.</p>

<p>"Where should we live? A part of the time in my
country, in America. There they would deem you a
dowry-hunter; it would be, it will be, impossible to
make them believe the contrary. You would feel yourself
despised. Then the life is so different, in an atmosphere
of distrust the life would seem to you eccentric,
grotesque, unbearable; and if I forced you to stay
there you would end by hating me."</p>

<p>"But with us? In this beautiful land?"</p>

<p>"Here <em>I</em> should suffer, dear Vittorio. To all you
Italian men and women I should always be the American
woman who had made a bargain, who had given her
dollars and bought a title. Principessa di Santalena!
Donna Mabel Lante della Scala! What a lot of people
would laugh on hearing the name, and would hide their
smiles, because I should have a palace and a park, and
would give dinners and garden-parties; but behind my
back, what sneers and criticisms, and evil speaking!
At your first betrayal how all would curse you in my
country, how all would say you were right in yours, and
all this because I, poor little woman, have a dowry of
fifty millions, and you fifteen hundred lire a month, on
which your mother must live."</p>

<p>She ceased, as if breathless from having made too
long a speech, she who was accustomed to short, clear
phrases, like all her race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"You never thought of this in the Engadine," he
interrupted.</p>

<p>"No, I never thought of it. Up there everything
was so beautiful and simple! Love was so pure and life
so easy!"</p>

<p>"Ah, how could you have forgotten that time,
Mabel?"</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten it. Afterwards I saw that
nothing is simple, nothing easy&mdash;neither life, nor love,
nor happiness&mdash;nothing, when there is this terrible,
powerful thing, money."</p>

<p>"What, then, do you want from me? What have
you come to seek from me?" he asked, half angrily
and half sadly.</p>

<p>"For you to give me a proof of what you are by your
birth, by your past, by your character; for you to free
me from the promise of engagement, frankly and spontaneously."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't do otherwise," he said, with a pale,
ironical smile.</p>

<p>"You could. If you were a vile calculator, if you
were a sordid, interested man you could. You have my
word, and my mother's; you have my father's; you
have my letters and my telegrams; you could force me
to marry you."</p>

<p>She looked him in the eyes fixedly. He fixed hers
unhesitatingly, without a tremble, and said to her in
a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Miss Mabel Clarke, I release you and your parents
from the engagement; I hold at your disposal your
letters and telegrams."</p>

<p>Mabel Clarke grew pale, and then blushed with a
rush of blood to her beautiful face; she offered her
hand to Vittorio Lante.</p>

<p>"I knew it, darling! I am very fond of you, and
shall always be fond of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Silent, impassive, he had performed his sacrifice in
the name of his honour; but the heroic act had consumed
him. There was a long silence between them.</p>

<p>"I shall start back to-morrow," she said, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, to-morrow!" he repeated, as if he did not quite
understand.</p>

<p>"Will you accompany me to Naples, where I shall
embark, dear?" she asked him affectionately, but with
a veil of sadness in her voice.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," he murmured weakly.</p>

<p>"You must be stronger, Vittorio."</p>

<p>"I have been strong," he replied, opening his arms.
"You must not ask more from me."</p>

<p>"You must not suffer, darling."</p>

<p>"I love you and suffer in loving you, Mabel," he said,
simply and sadly.</p>

<p>"I hope that will soon end."</p>

<p>"Eh, not so soon, not so soon," he added, with
melancholy and bitterness.</p>

<p>"You will return to your mother, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Later on I shall go. I must go there to explain
everything," he murmured.</p>

<p>Mabel, after having conquered him, experienced an
ever broader sympathy, an ever greater pity for him.
Every word in which he vainly poured forth his sorrow,
the undoing, the delusion of all his hopes, struck her good
and loyal heart more than all the cries of revolt which
had rushed from his lips. After having conquered him,
after being freed, she became his friend, his sister, loving
and sad, suffering in seeing him suffer, desiring that he
should suffer no more. But the man who had given all
his measure, who had accomplished his great act of
renunciation, could no longer be consoled by her; she
had lost the sentimental power of comforting him. But
she tried again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother expects you, Vittorio."</p>

<p>"Did you tell her everything?" he asked in a weak,
colourless voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I told her."</p>

<p>"Poor mamma," he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Vittorio, start a new life within and without
yourself! Sell the old palace and the old park. Pay
your debts. Take your mother away with you, and with
what is left try some undertaking, create an industry,
some work for yourself and others," she said energetically.</p>

<p>"I should require another soul, and another heart,"
he replied gloomily, with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>"Change your country and your surroundings," she
suggested energetically, as if she wished to inject some
will into him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought to come to America?" he asked,
with a pale, ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Why not? John Clarke would do everything for
you."</p>

<p>But suddenly she bit her lips, as she saw Vittorio's
contracted face become disturbed with pallor, as if under
an access of anger and grief.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks!" he said, with deep irony. "One
thing only John Clarke could do for me, and that I have
renounced. Must I come to America like a wretched
seeker after work, like an emigrant? Miss Mabel, we
shall separate without your understanding me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied humbly, "it has not been
vouchsafed me to understand you."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to be there, Miss Mabel, when
you marry the American, some American, of your race
and country?" he asked, with a sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, this will only happen much later," she murmured,
"very much later."</p>

<p>"But it will happen, Miss Mabel," he insisted bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe so," she said simply; "not now, not for a
year. Even later."</p>

<p>"Why should you wait, miss?" he asked sadly, with
ever greater sarcasm.</p>

<p>"To forget you, dear," she replied frankly.</p>

<p>He trembled, but restrained himself.</p>

<p>"You think us American women heartless, Vittorio.
You will never understand us."</p>

<p>Worn down, he again made a vague gesture of excuse.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Vittorio, I believe you will marry
Livia Lante, much sooner than I shall marry an
American."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We are very poor, Livia and I. One can endure
poverty when one is in love. I do not love Livia."</p>

<p>"Later solitude and boredom will oppress you. She
is sweet and gracious. She will beautify your life."</p>

<p>"I could never endure poverty but on one condition,
Mabel," he exclaimed suddenly, invaded by a new
exaltation.</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"With you, Mabel, with you! Ah, if only you were
a poor woman with a halfpenny for a dowry, without a
dress to your back, how I would dream of taking you,
of carrying you away with me, to work for you, my
companion, my spouse, my love, to look for work and
riches for you, but with you and for you!"</p>

<p>Pale, absorbed, she listened to him. He drew near to
her, took her hands, and spoke face to face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mabel, come away, come away with me, far-away,
renounce your millions, renounce all your money;
say to your father that you don't want a farthing, that
Vittorio Lante, your husband, wishes to work and
create with you and for you life and riches."</p>

<p>With closed eyes she vacillated in his arms, vacillated
beneath the wave of that enveloping passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mabel, you alone can make of me another man,
with another soul, with another heart! Mabel, remember,
remember our dreams of love in the Engadine,
remember that you consented to love me up there; you
did love me, you have been my beloved, you can't
forget! Change yourself, change me; be another
woman, give yourself to love, as I let myself be taken in
the great battle for you! Change yourself, as I change
myself! Deny not the arguments of love; be a woman
as other women, as I ask to be a man in every strife
however cruel. Mabel, Mabel, change yourself."</p>

<p>Holding her in his arms, a breath of scorching words
wrapped the girl as in a fire of flame. For the first time
Vittorio Lante saw on that face, so dazzling with youth
and beauty, a lost expression of love and sorrow. Still,
she was made for victory; she was the stronger. Tearing
herself free, she composed her face, and replied:</p>

<p>"Vittorio, it is impossible."</p>

<p>"Impossible?"</p>

<p>"No soul ever changes; at least, not for love. Each
soul remains what it is."</p>

<p>"It is true," he replied, coldly and sadly. "The soul
never changes, not even for love."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>A strong, fresh wind was coming from the deep,
raising the waters of the Adriatic in long waves of incomparable
light green, to hurl them, as they curved,
rolled, and almost curled in greenish white with a crown
of the whitest foam, and fragrant with the sharp smell
of the sea, on the long, straight shore of the Lido. The
waves broke one after the other, almost on top of each
other, on the soft, yellow sand of the beach, which became
dark with ever-increasing dark weals, and stained by the
swelling water as the waves gained ground. Here and
there the little mounds of seaweed and marine refuse on
the sand were invaded, covered, and demolished, as they
became higher and lower with the suction of the waves:
here and there holes and little ditches full of water were
being formed. The strong, fresh wind whirled round the
fashionable huts that stretched numerously in a line far
along the straight beach, and whirled around the vast
bathing establishment of the Lido, causing the doors of
the little cabins to rattle, and the linen to flutter, which
here and there had been exposed to dry: it whirled
round the immense covered terrace of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cafÃ©</i>, causing
the awnings to flap which were still lowered against the
sun.</p>

<p>Although it was one of the last days of September
and the afternoon was advancing, the sea was thronged
here and there with heads of bathers, whilst the beach
was full of people coming and going to and from the
sea, from the cabins and the little wooden staircases and
gangways. Down below on the shore, by the huts, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
children of various ages, watched over by nurses and
governesses, who were entering and leaving the water,
flying with little cries of joy from the tallest waves,
rolling on the sand, and jumping up again in a laughing,
delightful group. Rather nearer, black dots, with
brightly coloured coifs, large straw hats, sailing and
swimming on the pale green waves, indicated men and
women who were enjoying one of the last days of
summer, who were enjoying the sea with its clear waters
and disturbed waves, with perfumes so exhilarating,
and wind so fresh, and the great beach and soft shore.
From the horizon, on the incomparable green of the
Adriatic, two vessels approached in fraternal movement,
following, catching up, and passing each other, but
pursuing the same course. One had three sails, all
yellow, of a yellow-ochre, with certain strange signs of
darker yellow on their background; the other had sails
of red-bronze, with designs of deep red. When they were
nearer, one could see that on the yellow sails were designed
a cross, nails, a crown of thorns, to wit, a reminder
of the Passion of Jesus Christ; on the other was a little
Madonna of the Carmine&mdash;the <em>Ave Maria Stella</em>.</p>

<p>Towards four o'clock the terrace of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cafÃ©</i>, bathed
by the sun, was empty, with its hundred little tables
round which the flies buzzed; some of the awnings
were lowered, others were half raised. Slowly the scene
changed. The wind became stronger and fresher from
the depths; the children decided to enter the huts to
dress, as they continued their happy cries; one by one
the other bathers re-entered their cabins. The sea
became deserted, only on the shore the number of
persons who were promenading slowly increased, as
they tried to walk on the deep sand where the feet sank.
Now and then they halted to watch the sea, whose
waves became higher and whiter with their rounded
crests, as if the better to breathe the grand fresh air, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of saline aroma. Now other great vessels appeared,
more or less in the offing, with yellow, coppery, and
maroon sails, rendered darker by sun and brine.</p>

<p>The scene changed on the terrace as the sun declined.
All the awnings were raised, some frequenters appeared
to sit by the balustrade that gives on to the beach, to
take a place at the little tables along this balustrade,
whence all the vastness and beauty of that admirable
Lido seascape is to be viewed. The little steamers that
perform the small crossing&mdash;less than a crossing, a ferry&mdash;between
Venice and the island of the Lido half an
hour ago had arrived almost empty, but now they were
sending people continually towards the shore, people
who left the motionless waters of the shining, grey
lagoon, crossed the island still green with little trees,
still flourishing with growing flowers and plants, and
came to gaze at the free, resonant Adriatic, with its
wonderful green and white waves, with a sigh of relief
and a smile of greeting for the magnificent Italian sea.</p>

<p>Two or three tables were at first occupied; other
people arrived. Then the waiters began to glide from
table to table, a little bored, carrying large trays with
the necessaries for tea, pink and yellow <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sorbettes</i>, drinks
piled with little pieces of ice, wherein was fixed a straw.
It was not a large crowd, like that of strangers of all
nations in April, when they are mysteriously attired in
voluptuous flattery of the Venetian spring, not the great,
indigenous, Italian crowd of the month of August, that
chatters and laughs at the top of its voice, the ladies
dressed in white, fanning themselves, as they drink
large glasses of iced beer, far too much in the German
manner! It was the crowd of the end of September, a
little curious and strange, mingled with foreigners who
had come from Switzerland and the Italian lakes, mingled
with the Italians who had come from the Alps to the
plains at the end of the summer season. The crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
round the tables was small and not chatty or noisy.
To the charming, languid, sweet Venetian dialect issuing
from the beautiful lips of women, here and there was
united a French word, but above all was mingled the
rough German talk&mdash;in the majority everywhere, as
usual. The wind was now very fresh, and dull the breaking
of the waves down below on the soft sand: a few
promenaders went on the shore, watching the warm
tints of the sunset on the horizon, while large vessels
filed past with yellow-ochre sails, from which the Virgin
Mary gave her blessing.</p>

<p>For some time Vittorio Lante remained alone at a
small table in a far corner of the terrace: before him
was a tall glass full of a greenish drink, exhaling a smell
of peppermint, but he forgot to sip it. The keen expression
of life, which had distinguished him in the Engadine,
had vanished from the young man's graceful but virile
face. He seemed calm, but without thoughts, and all
his features appeared grosser in that thoughtless calm.
His eyes glanced without vivacity, as they fixed themselves
indifferently on the people and things around
him; he was not sad or happy, but indifferent. He
smoked a cigarette and lit another, which remained
between his fingers without his bringing it to his mouth,
while a thread of smoke issued from it. Suddenly someone
stopped at his table, bent over him, and called him,
as he greeted him in a low voice. He raised his eyes
and was amazed to see Lucio Sabini standing before
him.</p>

<p>"Dear Vittorio, you here!"</p>

<p>"Dear Sabini, welcome!"</p>

<p>They shook hands and looked at each other for a long
moment, as if each wished to read in the other's face the
story of the two years in which they had not seen each
other. Certainly Lucio Sabini was the more deeply
changed. His black hair, where up to thirty-five not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
single silver thread had appeared, now was quite streaked
with white round the temples; his face from being thin
had become fleshless; his black eyes that had been so
proud seemed extinguished; the shoulders of the tall,
slender figure were a little bent, and all his physiognomy
had an expression of weariness, of failing strength, of
vanished energy.</p>

<p>"Are you alone, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"I am here alone, Sabini."</p>

<p>"Disengaged?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I will sit a little with you."</p>

<p>He sat down opposite him, and became silent, as he
watched the sea.</p>

<p>"Won't you take something, dear friend?" asked
Vittorio, with careful courtesy.</p>

<p>"If I must, I will take some sort of coloured water,"
murmured Lucio Sabini, and his long, brown, very thin
hand brushed his black moustache in a familiar gesture.
Again they looked at each other intensely. Lucio seemed
to make an effort to begin an ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>"Have you been long in Venice, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"No, just a week. We have come from Vallombrosa,
where we stayed till September was advanced."</p>

<p>"Is Vallombrosa amusing?"</p>

<p>"No; boring."</p>

<p>"Your wife, Donna Livia, likes it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. She likes forests with their large trees.
She lived there from morning till evening."</p>

<p>"Is Donna Livia here?"</p>

<p>"I left her for tea with some friends in Venice, and
came here to pass an hour alone."</p>

<p>"Is she willing to leave you alone?"</p>

<p>"She lets me. She knows I like my freedom ... to do
nothing with it. So she herself lets me go free, to please
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>They spoke in a low voice, bending a little over the
table, looking distractedly, now at the beverages from
which they had not sipped a drop, now a little to their
right at the shore and the sea; but their glances seemed
to be aware of nothing. Suddenly Lucio Sabini, fixing his
worn-out eyes on those of Vittorio, questioned him more
brightly, with his dull voice from which all <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">timbre</i>
seemed extinguished.</p>

<p>"Are you happy, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"I am not happy, but I am not unhappy," he replied,
turning his head away, as if to hide the sudden expression
of his face.</p>

<p>"Are you contented with that?"</p>

<p>"I have no choice of anything else," replied Vittorio,
with a wan smile.</p>

<p>"And is Donna Livia happy?"</p>

<p>"She asks nothing else of life than to have me. She
has me."</p>

<p>"Then all is well, Vittorio?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for Livia."</p>

<p>"And for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for me nothing can go well or ill, Sabini."</p>

<p>This he said with such an accent of indifference, of
detachment, that it amounted more to sadness. After
a slight hesitation Lucio resumed:</p>

<p>"Vittorio, you were ardently in love with that
American girl."</p>

<p>"Ardently is the word," agreed Vittorio Lante, in a
rather louder voice.</p>

<p>"How did you let her escape you?"</p>

<p>"I gave her up."</p>

<p>"Although you loved her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, although I adored her, I gave her up."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"So as not to be dishonoured, Lucio. Had I married
her I should have been dishonoured."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because of her money."</p>

<p>"Exactly; because of her superfluity of money, her
immense amount of money; because of my immense
poverty."</p>

<p>A soft veil passed before Vittorio's eyes. The other
looked at him, and said:</p>

<p>"It hurts you, then, to talk of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now and then it hurts me; but the pain is
always less, and always at greater intervals, Sabini. I
am almost cured."</p>

<p>"Did you suffer much?"</p>

<p>"Very much, as if I should die of it. However, I am
not dead; it seems one doesn't die of that."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Lucio, waving a hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he murmured; "I had my mother,
whom I ought not to make more unhappy; perhaps
I was unworthy to conceive a lofty sorrow. Who knows?
I haven't been given either a great soul or great will.
It is not my fault if I am not dead, if I am almost
healed."</p>

<p>This time a sense of irony against himself and his
own mediocrity escaped from his indifference.</p>

<p>"Poor Vittorio!" said Lucio, pressing his hand
across the table, "tell me everything. You can tell me
everything, I can understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, mine isn't such an interesting story!" exclaimed
Vittorio, with a pale smile of irony; "if you
like, it is rather a stupid story. I was such a fool in the
Engadine! I went there to find a girl, neither too
beautiful nor too ugly, and not very rich, who could drag
my mother and myself out of our difficulties; I went
with a definite programme, a vulgar but definite programme,
unromantic but definite, that of a dowry-hunter.
Instead of looking for a mediocre girl, with a
dowry of six or seven hundred thousand lire, like a
child, like an idiot, I make straight for Mabel Clarke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
who has fifty millions. I put forward my candidature
as a flirt to good purpose, and conquered all rivals.
Fool, thrice a fool that I was! Instead of keeping my
presence of mind, and all my wits, I fall in love with her
because she is beautiful, fresh, young, new, and of
another race; because we were free, and left free, as is
the American custom, as you know quite well, so that
at last the girl of fifty millions falls in love with me."</p>

<p>"She did love you, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she loved me in her way," answered Vittorio,
shortly.</p>

<p>"She suffered through you."</p>

<p>"She suffered less intensely, but longer, perhaps.
Even in this she beat me, Lucio! What a common
story, is it not? How could I have thought that the
world and my destiny would have permitted me to marry
Mabel Clarke with her fifty millions, to be the son-in-law
of John Clarke, who, at his death, would have left other
two hundred millions? I? I? And why? Who was
I, more than another, of my country or another, of my
set or another, who was I to reach to such power? I
was neither a true pleasure-seeker, nor properly vicious,
nor a cynic. Seriously, I was nothing but a&mdash;calculator.
I was nothing serious, my friend. If I had been in
earnest as a calculator I should not have fallen in love
with Mabel Clarke. What a mistake, or rather, what a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucherie</i>!"</p>

<p>"You can't forget her, Vittorio," whispered Lucio,
looking at him with tender eyes.</p>

<p>"You are wrong. I forget her more and more.
Besides, have I not married Livia?"</p>

<p>"Why did you make that marriage?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que faire?</i>" he exclaimed, shrugging his shoulders.
"I was so sad, so broken in bone and soul, as if I had
fallen from a precipice, and had been dragged out half
living. I was so bored. And poor little Livia was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
languishing in silence waiting for me. And did not my
mother look at me with beseeching eyes every time I
went to Terni? I married through sadness, fastidiousness,
weakness, to make an end of everything, and, as
you see, in spite of all my ardent love for Mabel Clarke I
did not know how to be faithful to her for more than a
year. The American girl had foreseen it&mdash;Mabel Clarke
was stronger, wiser, more direct than I, and much better
too. She humbled me in sending a rich gift to Livia on
her wedding, and she invited us to America. Ah, how
strange these women are!"</p>

<p>"She invited you to America? She writes to
you?"</p>

<p>"Often, long letters. From the very first she wanted
me to go to America to gain money with John Clarke,
and she did not believe she would offend me by asking
me."</p>

<p>They were both silent for a moment, absorbed and
concentrated. Around them people began to leave the
tables, as the shadows of dusk were falling from the sky
on sea and beach and the flowered island; but they were
unaware of it.</p>

<p>"Besides, dear Sabini," resumed Vittorio, with a
degree of greater sarcasm, "I am less poor than I was
formerly. Then I spent too much to find the heiress
with the great fortune, to live grandly, and to travel.
When I announced that I was marrying Livia, Uncle
Costrucci, an old clerical, was moved, and let us have,
for our natural lifetime, a beautiful suite of apartments in
old Rome, in via Botheghe Oscure. Mamma has come
to live with us, and her cousin, Farnese, made her a
present of a carriage. Ours is a marriage which has been
made by public subscription! We have our house and
our carriage. Livia is so charming in her discreet
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toilettes</i>, discreet in every fashion. I haven't to strive as
I thought, I have not even been forced to work as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
supposed. There is nothing of the heroic in me&mdash;a
mediocre destiny, and a mediocre life!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Vittorio, you still suffer," said Lucio, in a deeply
moved voice.</p>

<p>"In my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>, I confess. Think, Lucio, how I
have been treated&mdash;surrounded, knocked on the head
like a lamb under calumnies, defamations and vituperations,
in every land where international society
gathers&mdash;and how I have been unable to cuff a single one
of my adversaries. Think how rivers of ink have been
poured out in the papers of two worlds to defame me,
and how I have been unable to spit in the face of a single
one of those journalists; think how I have been unable
to defend myself or offer a fight, solely because I loved
Mabel and Mabel loved me. And afterwards, Lucio,
what an incurable offence to my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>, this
breaking off the marriage, which sanctions the calumnies,
this breaking off ... and how everyone laughed at me
afterwards, and if they do not laugh at Livia and me
now it is because we are a quiet, modest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mÃ©nage</i> that
lives in the shade&mdash;we are an insignificant couple now."</p>

<p>"Another man, Vittorio, would never have consented
to breaking off the marriage."</p>

<p>"Another! I consented because I loved Mabel; I
loved her like a child, like a Don Quixote, with such fire
and devotion as to become a hero&mdash;and I so mediocre!
Through love I renounced my every good, but of my
own free will. Ah, if I had not loved her! If I had been
a cold and interested man, even under the impulse of an
amorous caprice; if I had kept my clearness of mind,
even in flirting to extremes, how different everything
would have been. If I had not loved her I could have
fled with her ten times from the Engadine, and she
would have been compromised and the marriage would
have been inevitable. If I had not loved her I would
not so ingenuously have allowed her to set out alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
for America; if I had not loved her I would have
provoked a duel at every defamation and reduced my
defamers to silence. At the first injurious article of the
American newspapers I would have gone over there to
make them show cause in the law courts; if I had not
loved her I should have been able to force her to keep
her engagements, and I should have obtained her by
force, her and her fortune; but I should have obtained
her. I loved her, and I destroyed my happiness and my
life."</p>

<p>With dreamy eyes, full of incurable sadness, he gazed
at the Adriatic which was becoming intensely green,
like an emerald, in the twilight. He added:</p>

<p>"Lucio, love has been my mistake; I committed
suicide because of it. But what is more laughable and
grotesque, I survive my suicide."</p>

<p>In spite of his cold delirium, as he turned to Lucio he
perceived that he had become pale, as if he were about
to die; he saw that Lucio's thin brown hand was
pressing his cigarette-case convulsively. Vittorio composed
himself, turned towards his friend, and touching
his hand lightly, said:</p>

<p>"How I beg your pardon! I must have bored you
so much with this tale of my woes."</p>

<p>Lucio Sabini bowed a denial with a vague and sad
gesture of his hand, without replying; he bowed his
denial with a vague smile that vanished immediately.</p>

<p>"Do not think that I tell everyone how it still torments
me in the depths of my soul; no one knows anything
of it; none must know. But you went up with
me to the Engadine on a summer evening, do you
remember? You were a witness of my joy up there."</p>

<p>"And also you, Vittorio, were my witness up there,"
murmured Lucio, grimly and gloomily.</p>

<p>Vittorio trembled and leant over the table to Lucio.</p>

<p>"Ah, that too is a sad story," he murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sad do you call it, only sad?" exclaimed the other,
with a great vibration of sorrow in his voice. Confused
and disturbed, Vittorio in his turn stammered:</p>

<p>"I knew&mdash;I read."</p>

<p>"What did you know? What did you read?" asked
Lucio Sabini in a strong, vibrant voice.</p>

<p>"In the papers ... a few lines ... I read of Miss
Lilian Temple's accident," added Vittorio in a low voice.</p>

<p>"You mean to say Miss Lilian Temple's death, my
friend," exclaimed Lucio, with a strange accent; "she is
dead, my friend."</p>

<p>"I did not wish to pronounce the word death, my
friend," Vittorio replied quietly.</p>

<p>Now they were alone on the terrace, on which the
evening was descending. Everyone had left to take the
little steamer back to Venice from the other side of the
Lido. The terrace was quite deserted, and all the Lido
shore, whose yellow sand remained bright beneath the
evening shadows; and deserted the ample Adriatic,
now of the deepest green in the evening gloom.</p>

<p>"She was twenty," said a weak, feeble voice, which
Vittorio hardly recognised as Lucio's.</p>

<p>"It is very early to die."</p>

<p>"I ought to have died, I who am thirty-seven, and
have lived double that time, I who am tired, old, and
finished with everything. It was just that I should die,
not she, who was twenty," said the weak voice.</p>

<p>"But how did the accident happen?" asked Vittorio.</p>

<p>"What accident?"</p>

<p>"The Alpine catastrophe in which the poor little girl
perished."</p>

<p>Ah, what a horrible smile of torture contracted Lucio's
livid lips!</p>

<p>"There was no accident, there was no Alpine catastrophe.
Miss Lilian Temple killed herself."</p>

<p>"Killed herself?" cried Vittorio, stupefied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"She killed herself."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"As of my life and death. She killed herself."</p>

<p>"Ah, how cruel! how atrocious!" broke in Vittorio.</p>

<p>"And she was only twenty," replied the feeble voice
again, like a lament.</p>

<p>A heavy, lugubrious silence fell upon the twain, in
that solitary corner of the great deserted terrace before
the Adriatic.</p>

<p>"Would you like to read her last words, Vittorio?"
asked Lucio.</p>

<p>The other started and nodded. Lucio drew out from
an inner pocket his pocket-book, took from it a long
white envelope, and drew delicately from it a picture
post card. The two friends bent forward together over
that piece of paper to distinguish its design and read
the words thereon. On one side the post card had the
address written in slender, tall calligraphy and firm
handwriting, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã  Don Lucio Sabini, Lung' Arno Serristori,
Firenze</i>." The postage-stamp was of the 24th of April
of the previous year, and came from the Hospice of the
Bernina. On the other side was a great panorama of
glaciers, of lofty, terrible peaks, and printed beneath
the German words, "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gruss vom Diavolezza</i>." The same
slender, upright characters had written, in a corner of
the card, beneath the great strip of white of the glacier
in English, "For ever, my love.&mdash;Lilian." Both raised
their heads and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"She died the next day, the 25th of April," said Lucio,
holding the card in his hands and gazing at it, as if he
saw it for the first time. "These are her last words.
She wrote them in the Hospice of the Bernina, and
posted them in the letter-box of the faÃ§ade of the Hospice.
Next morning she left very early for La Diavolezza; at
four o'clock in the afternoon she was dead, having fallen
headlong from a lofty crevasse of the Isola Persa."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke slowly, with a precise accent, that rendered
even more sorrowful the expression of his words.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see where she died, Vittorio?"
he resumed. "Look carefully."</p>

<p>Again, with tragic curiosity in the evening half-light,
the two men leant over that funereal document.</p>

<p>"Look carefully. This is La Diavolezza, a mountain
which is climbed without great difficulty, and where is
unfolded an immense panorama of glaciers and peaks.
I have been there and described it to her. Look carefully;
she reached as far as here, and rested only an
hour in this Alpine hut. She wanted to proceed at once
to the glacier here, where it is marked, the Perso
Glacier, this great black moraine that cuts the glacier
in two, which is called the Isola Persa&mdash;it is written
beneath. Look closely; you will not discover the
crevasse where she fell, where <em>she wished to fall</em>, but it is
here&mdash;where she wished to fall and to die."</p>

<p>"But how do you know?"</p>

<p>"She cut the rope which fastened her to her guide
with a knife."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"The guide told me: I saw the little torn piece of
cut rope. I went over all Lilian Temple's last journey,"
said Lucio gloomily.</p>

<p>Suddenly he threw himself with arms and head on the
table, holding to his mouth the post card whereon were
written Lilian Temple's last words murmuring with
tearless sighs that rent his breast:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love ... at twenty."</p>

<p>Silent, astonished, Vittorio waited till the moment of
weak anguish passed. Then he leant towards the man,
whose sighs became less, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Lucio, pull yourself together. Let us go away."
The electric lamps, which had been suddenly lit, illuminated
the terrace; the waiters arrived with linen, glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and silver to set the tables for dinner, since foreigners
and Venetians, on warm evenings, came to dine there
in the open air before the sea, where one of the usual
orchestras played. There was a coming and going of
these waiters, and a rattling of glass and china. In
dull, equal, monotonous voice, the Adriatic broke
against the shores of the Lido. The wind had fallen.</p>

<p>"Let us go away," repeated Vittorio.</p>

<p>With a rapid movement Lucio started up: his eyes
were red, although he had shed no tears, his face seemed
feverish. Both approached the exit, crossed the theatre
hall and the vestibule, and found themselves at the door.
They went out into the island before the large central
avenue, where the tramway runs amongst the trees,
gardens, and villas. They had not uttered a single word.
When once again they were in the open air before the
little square where the tramway stops Lucio said shortly:</p>

<p>"Shall we walk across the island, Vittorio? We shall
always find a steamer on the other side to take us back to
Venice."</p>

<p>"Let us walk."</p>

<p>They walked in silence along the little garden in
course of construction, by villas hardly finished, beneath
the young trees, amidst the white electric lamps and the
shadows formed between the lamps. Suddenly Lucio
Sabini stopped. He leant over the fence of a garden
covered with rambler roses and said in a desperate
voice:</p>

<p>"Vittorio, I killed Lilian Temple."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, don't say that."</p>

<p>"I committed the crime, Vittorio. I killed her. It is
as if I had taken her by the hand, led her up there to the
Isola Persa, and pointing to the precipice had said to
her&mdash;'<em>Throw yourself down</em>.' Thus am I guilty."</p>

<p>"Your reasonable grief blinds you, Lucio."</p>

<p>"No, no," he answered in his desperate voice, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
not blind, I am not mad. Time has passed over my
sorrow: it has become vast and deep like a great, black
lake which I have in the depths of my soul. I am neither
mad nor blind. I exist, I live, I perform coldly and
surely all the acts of life. Nevertheless, I committed
a crime, in thrusting Lilian Temple to her death with
my very own hands."</p>

<p>"But you are not an assassin, you are not a cruel
man," protested Vittorio vehemently. "You could not
have done it."</p>

<p>"That is true: I am not an assassin, I am not a cruel
man, but every unconscious word of mine, every unconscious
act of mine, was a mortal thrust whereby this
creature of beauty and purity, whereby this gentle
creature should go to her death."</p>

<p>His sharp, despairing voice broke in tenderness.
They began to walk again, side by side.</p>

<p>"You loved her then, Lucio?" asked Vittorio
affectionately.</p>

<p>"Yes, I loved her very much; but with a sudden and
violent love which made me forget my slavery, my
galley, and the rough chain that oppresses me. I loved
her, but I ought to have been silent and not have lost
my peace and made her lose her peace. Here began my
sad sin, Vittorio."</p>

<p>"Did she know nothing about you? Did you tell
her nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing: she knew nothing; she wished to know
nothing. Thus she gave me her heart and her life. I
ought to have spoken; I ought to have told her everything.
I was so madly in love. I was silent and in my
silence deceived her. Ah, what a sin! What a terrible
sin was that!"</p>

<p>"Did no one warn her?"</p>

<p>"No one. Her soul was mine without a doubt or a
thought, with immense certainty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"But didn't you in all this understand the danger
into which you were both running?"</p>

<p>"I didn't understand," replied Lucio Sabini, tragically.
"I didn't understand Lilian Temple's love till
after her death."</p>

<p>"You knew that she loved you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but how many others have loved me for a
fortnight or a month, afterwards to forget me!"</p>

<p>"Did she not tell you how much she loved you?"</p>

<p>"She told me a little, but I did not understand."</p>

<p>"But did she not show you?"</p>

<p>"She showed me a little, but I didn't understand.
My eyes did not know how to read her soul or guess the
riddle of her heart."</p>

<p>"But why? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because she was of another country, of another
race; because she was another soul different from all
the other souls I have known; because I had another
heart. Lilian was unknown to me, and I let her die."</p>

<p>Slowly they reached the end of the long avenue that
divides the little island and reached the shore of the
lagoon, where no majestic hotels and sumptuous villas
arise, but old Venetian houses of fishermen, sailors, and
gondoliers. Already in the nocturnal gloom lights were
to be seen flickering on the turbid waters. Once again
Lucio stopped, as if speaking to himself; Vittorio
stopped beside him, patiently, affectionately, pitifully.</p>

<p>"Oh, these Englishwomen, these Englishwomen," he
said, passing his hand over his forehead. "Even if they
are very young, even if they are twenty, as my poor love,
as my poor Lilian, they have an interior life of singular
intensity, whilst an absolute calm reigns in their faces
and actions. They hide sentiments within their souls
with a force, power, and ardour which would stupefy
and frighten us if we could see within them for an instant.
They have an absolute power over themselves and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
expressions, a surprising domination over every manifestation.
These Englishwomen&mdash;Lilian, Lilian mine!
They say what they mean, not a word more, they express
what they wish to express, no more; they know how to
control themselves in the most impetuous moments of
life, they know how to encloister themselves when everyone
else would expand, and they find their greatest
pride in their spiritual isolation, apart from whatever
surrounds them, whatever is happening, far-away,
closed in their interior life, in their kingdom, in their
temple. Their heart is their temple. How often my
dear Lilian was silent beside me, and I did not understand
how full of things was her silence: how often she
would have liked to fall into my arms, but restrained
herself and merely smiled: how often she would have
liked to cry and not a tear fell from her beautiful eyes;
how often I found her cold, indifferent, apart from me,
and never perhaps had she been more mine than in that
moment. So I understood not how she loved me, because
she was of another race, strong, firm, thoughtful, taciturn,
faithful; because Lilian had another soul and all
her soul escaped me."</p>

<p>They had now passed on to the pier, beneath its
wooden roof, to take the steamer which should bring
them back to Venice. But no steamer was leaving at
that moment, although far-off two large red lights were
to be seen approaching rapidly towards the shores of the
Lido. The two friends sat down on a wooden bench, in
a badly lit corner, and resumed their conversation <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto
voce</i>, for other travellers were there, waiting with them
for the steamer.</p>

<p>"These Englishwomen," resumed Lucio, speaking as
if in a sad dream. "On a day in February there comes
to my home, in Florence, Lilian's best friend, her most
affectionate guardian, Miss May Ford, she who always
accompanied her at St. Moritz: you remember her?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
And the good old maid stands there, quiet, imperturbable,
while she asks an explanation of such a serious
matter, that is, why I have deserted Lilian Temple;
and she asks me with such simplicity and indifference,
almost as if it were a matter of the least importance,
and my pain and sorrowful embarrassment caused her
wonder. She does not defend Lilian, nor Lilian's love,
but is at once content with my reasons. Not that only!
When I ask her to use her good influence to make Lilian
forget me, she at once promises to do so. If I suggest
that she should tell Lilian that I love her, but that I
ought not, that I shall always love her, but still I ought
to fly from her, Miss Ford declares that she will not
give this message because it would make her worse;
and finally when I, to show her what an invincible and
mortal reason prevents me from loving Lilian, tell her of
my adultery, that is of my sad servitude, when I suggest
to her that a lady could kill herself if I desert her for
Lilian; coldly, without protesting, she agrees to bear
this embassy of death. Do you understand, Vittorio?
Miss May is tenderly fond of Lilian, knows, perhaps,
that Lilian loves me deeply, knows, perhaps, that Lilian
will not forget me, that she will never console herself
for my desertion, yet through reserve, correctness,
moderation, through that proud habit of sentimental
modesty, that habit of proud and noble silence which
these Englishwomen have, so as not to humiliate me or
herself, so as not to humiliate her friend, to conceal
from herself, from me, and all whatever there was
exalting and agonising in our drama of love, this Englishwoman
says nothing to me and to Lilian; only a few&mdash;very
few&mdash;words, the least number of words possible,
a single phrase, the one necessary, which she had asked
from me to take back to her, and she takes back this
single phrase&mdash;and it was an embassy of death!"</p>

<p>"And did not Miss Ford even know Lilian's heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and of her love?" murmured Vittorio sadly; "did they
confide little or nothing to each other, through respect
and modesty?"</p>

<p>"Not even Miss Ford understood. One day in April
Lilian disappeared from her home in London. She left
not a letter or a note for her father; she did not write
to Miss Ford, who at that moment was in Somersetshire&mdash;nothing,
she disappeared. After ten days, in which
Lilian's father placed an advertisement every day in the
<em>Times</em> in search of her, to get her to return, the news of
her death arrived."</p>

<p>"Probably not even her family understood that it
was a question of suicide."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Lucio Sabini in a thin voice,
"they caused it to be said that it was an accident:
perhaps they believed it was an accident."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"In my post card, Vittorio, you read but two words,
which could be a sorrowful farewell, a sad and tender
remembrance. She covered with modesty and silence
her passion and her death."</p>

<p>The little steamer was already at the pier, the gangway
had been thrown across, fifteen or twenty passengers
crossed it and passed into the boat. They scattered here
and there on benches along the steamer's sides, which
set off again immediately. Lucio and Vittorio went
and sat in the front of the boat, at the prow, receiving
in their faces the fresh evening breeze, no longer the
strong wind of the day which for so many hours had
blown from the Adriatic on the shores of the Lido,
but the little wind of the lagoon which scarcely ruffled
the blackish waters, a breeze that blew from the Canal
of the Giudecca and rendered more charming the Venetian
evening. With even movement the little steamer
threaded its way, cleaving the almost motionless waters;
making for the brown, fragrant mass, in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
light, of the Venetian gardens. Below a bright clear
light was spreading itself over the city and waters.
Towards San Marco and the Grand Canal the light was
completely white, while other lights from palaces,
houses, steamers, and gondolas waved and scintillated
everywhere, far and near, throwing soft streaks of light
and flying gleams over the waters. Silent and tired the
two friends remained seated, almost as if they were
unaware of the movement, so regular was the going of
the little boat; and they were unaware of sounds, as
everything around them was peace and shadow. Venice
flashed with light that brightened the shadows of the
lagoon, the houses, and the sky, and she seemed surrounded
by a starry aureole; but they did not even
look at the majestic spectacle, as if in the desolation of
their souls neither beauty nor poesy of things could
attract them. The steamer bent to the right to the
stopping-place at the gardens: a louder and duller noise
spoke of their arrival, the gangway was thrown across
to the pier; a few embarked for Venice, but no one got
off. The steamer drew farther away noisily, and resumed
its course in the middle of the lagoon.</p>

<p>"Now I am going to find my accomplice," said Lucio
in a dry voice.</p>

<p>"Accomplice?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Beatrice Herz strangely helped me to kill
Lilian," added Lucio, with a sneer in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Is she here in Venice?"</p>

<p>"Of course! How could my accomplice be elsewhere?
Where I go, she goes; where she goes, I follow.
We are inseparable, dearest Victor. Oh, it is touching!"</p>

<p>And a stridulous laugh of irony escaped him.</p>

<p>"Did she know all?" asked Vittorio in a low voice.</p>

<p>"From the first moment," resumed Lucio in a voice
become dry and hard. "When I separated myself from
Lilian, enamoured as I was, wildly in love, in fact, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
a mad hope, I believed in a generous madness, and told
Beatrice Herz everything. Was she not at bottom a
woman of heart? Had she not suffered atrociously for
love? Had she not a very tender attachment for me?
I believed in the superiority of her mind and her magnanimity;
I asked for an heroic deed. I had loved and
served her for ten years; I had given her my youth,
and consumed my most beautiful hours and strength
for her; I asked her to dismiss me as a good, loving,
and true servant, who had accomplished his cycle of
servitude, and at last wished to be free. Humbly and
ardently I begged her, with tears in my eyes, turning to
her as to a sacred image, to perform the miracle, to give
me liberty, to allow me yet to live some years of good
and happiness&mdash;the few that remained to me for love."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Vittorio, with sad curiosity.</p>

<p>"I believed Beatrice Herz to be a heroine, capable of
a great proof of altruism; I believed her capable of a
sentimental miracle. On the contrary, she is a mean
little woman, a wretched, egotistical creature, a puppet
without thought or heart, in whom my love and my
illusion had placed something of the sublime. She is
nothing. She refused precisely; she was as arid as
pumice-stone; she had not a moment's pity or a single
trace of emotion. She sees nothing but herself and her
social interests. Instead of giving me my freedom she
abandoned herself to such scenes of jealousy, now
ferocious, now trivial, from which I escaped each time
worn-out and nauseated."</p>

<p>"Had you never the strength to break with her?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't the strength," added Lucio sharply. "Of
recent years she has threatened to kill herself when I
spoke of leaving her. I always believed her. When it
was a question of Lilian her threats became even more
violent; twice I had to snatch from her hands a little
revolver. But it was really nothing, Vittorio! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
wasn't true! I was deceived in the first place, and was
deceived afterwards. Beatrice Herz never meant to
kill herself for me. I have lived ten years with this
woman, and she has succeeded in deceiving me. She
is not the sort of woman to kill herself. Even in this I
have been disillusioned about her. She is a paltry little
woman, nothing else."</p>

<p>"Still she loved you; she confronted dangers for you;
she compromised herself and lost her name for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes! But adultery with all its waste and
lies, adultery with all its corruptions, this adultery
prolonged to the boredom and disgust of both, only for
womanly vanity, the great vanity of not being deserted,
has conquered all her pride."</p>

<p>"You reproach her with her sin!"</p>

<p>"I reproach myself as well as her. I reproach myself
as well as her for having sent Lilian Temple to her
death."</p>

<p>"Beatrice did not know."</p>

<p>"Beatrice did not deserve to," exclaimed Lucio, again
becoming exalted. "She deserved no sacrifice, neither
mine nor Lilian's&mdash;I keep telling her that."</p>

<p>"You tell her that!"</p>

<p>"Always. Our life is a hell," added Lucio gloomily.</p>

<p>"But doesn't Beatrice try with sweetness...."</p>

<p>"Sweetness? Don't you know that she is jealous of
my poor Lilian, of my poor dead one? Don't you know
that she still makes scenes of jealousy?"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"It is so. When I read in the papers the dread news,
when I read Lilian's poor, sweet, last words from up
there, and understood that she had killed herself, like
one possessed I set off by night for the Engadine. Ah,
Vittorio, Vittorio, that second journey to ascend there
from Chiavenna, what atrocious anxiety all that journey
which I made alone, to the Maloja, to St. Moritz, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Bernina, in a time of perfect solitude, with the snow
hardly melted, with St. Moritz still shut up as if dead.
The roads were still difficult, as everywhere I followed
step for step the tracks of my poor little one who had
gone up there, who had lovingly and piously visited all
the places where we had been together&mdash;step for step
after Lilian's tracks until one night I slept in the house
of the guide who had seen her die; the man's eyes were
full of tears as he told me of her death. Well, when I,
full of horror and sorrow, pierced by remorse, unconsoled
and unconsolable, came away, whatever do you think
Beatrice Herz did? She came to meet me in the Engadine,
to snatch me back. She said so&mdash;just to snatch
me back. I found her in the inn at Chiavenna, whence
she was hurrying to ascend to the Engadine. I found
her there, and instead of weeping with me, instead of
asking pardon of God, she acted a scene of jealousy, and
insulted the dead and me."</p>

<p>"Oh, how horrible!"</p>

<p>"Horrible! For that matter I told her a great and
simple truth, which made her rave, and always makes
her rave; so I repeat it to her."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"That she had loved me ten years, and did not know
how to die for me, and that Lilian Temple had loved me
one month and had died for me."</p>

<p>"She must suffer atrociously from all this?"</p>

<p>"Atrociously. I hate Beatrice Herz, and she hates me."</p>

<p>"Yet you remain together?"</p>

<p>"Always. All our lives. Only death, longed-for
death, will free us," said Lucio with a sigh.</p>

<p>They gradually drew near to the pier of San Marco;
the lagoon was full of gondolas, white and red lights
caught the steamer and showed up faces.</p>

<p>"Listen, Vittorio," said Lucio, placing a hand tenderly
on his friend's arm, "your love adventure has caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
you to suffer much; but to-morrow you will be healed,
because you have no remorse, because you have accomplished
a lofty duty of honour in destroying your happiness;
but you have no remorse. Create none, Vittorio.
When at last the beautiful, dazzling figure of Mabel
Clarke has vanished from your spirit, love your wife, who
is good and sweet, who has been humble and patient,
who is fond of you, and attends your good. Love her,
not another woman; love her, and never the woman of
another. Vittorio, don't be lost as I am lost; don't
throw to the monster adultery&mdash;your flesh, and senses,
and heart. Don't create for yourself remorses which will
render your life a place of torment as it is for me."</p>

<p>They reached the Riva degli Schiavoni, the waters
were astir with gondolas, and the <em>Riva</em> with people, and
full of light and bustle. They went ashore together.
They stood silently for a few moments before separating,
while around them life was humming, though pale and
exhausted they were unaware of it.</p>

<p>"Do you remember Chassellas?" asked Lucio, with
singular sweetness.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it. I went there with Mabel,"
replied the other, with repressed emotion.</p>

<p>"Do you know the little Engadine cemetery near
there?"</p>

<p>"I know it, we gathered flowers there one day, Mabel
and I."</p>

<p>"Lilian is buried there; not far from poor Massimo
Granata. I too shall sleep there one day; the soonest
possible, Vittorio."</p>

<p>Vittorio, pale and exhausted, looked at him.</p>

<p>"I long to die," said Lucio Sabini.</p>

<p>They said nothing more, but separated.</p>
